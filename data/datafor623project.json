The biggest news of all, though, would be if Justice Anthony Kennedy were to use the court\u2019s last public session on Monday to announce his retirement. To be sure, Kennedy has given no public sign that he will retire this year and give President Trump his second high court pick in the first months of his administration. Kennedy\u2019s departure would allow conservatives to take firm control of the court. Advertisement But Kennedy turns 81 next month and has been on the court for nearly 30 years. Several of his former law clerks have said they think he is contemplating stepping down in the next year or so. Kennedy and his clerks were gathering over the weekend for a reunion that was pushed up a year and helped spark talk he might be leaving the court.

Sign up for more newsletters here \u2018\u2018Soon we\u2019ll know if rumors of Kennedy\u2019s retirement are accurate,\u2019\u2019 one former Kennedy clerk, George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, said on Twitter on Friday. When the justices take the bench Monday, they are expected to decide the case of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Mo., which was excluded from a state grant program to pay for soft surfaces on playgrounds run by not-for-profit groups. The case is being closely watched by advocates of school vouchers, who hope the court will make it easier to use state money to pay for private, religious schooling in states that now prohibit it. Missouri has since changed its policy under Republican Governor Eric Greitens so that churches may now apply for the money. Advertisement Also expected in the next few days, though there\u2019s no deadline by which the court must decide, is a ruling on whether to allow the administration to immediately enforce a 90-day ban on visitors from six mostly Muslim countries. Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, could play a pivotal role in both the travel ban and church playground cases. In all, six cases that were argued between November and April remain undecided. Three of those, all involving immigrants or foreigners, were heard by an eight-justice court, before Gorsuch joined the bench in April. If the eight justices are evenly divided, those cases could be argued a second time in the fall, with Gorsuch available to provide the tie-breaking vote. In his short time on the court, Gorsuch has already paired up four times with Justice Clarence Thomas \u2014 the court\u2019s most conservative member \u2014 in separate opinions that dissent from or take issue with the court\u2019s majority rulings. Advertisement While the sample size is small, the results show Gorsuch\u2019s commitment to follow the strict text of the law and a willingness to join Thomas in pushing the envelope further than the court\u2019s other conservatives. Gorsuch was picked by Trump to be a reliable conservative in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. But the question after his confirmation hearings was how far to the right he would be. The early trend of Gorsuch and Thomas acting together has pleased those who hoped Gorsuch would continue Scalia\u2019s legacy and be another intellectual beacon for conservatives. The latest instance came Friday when Gorsuch issued his first written dissent in a minor case about a federal employee challenging his dismissal from the US Census Bureau. The dispute was over where Anthony Perry could appeal a case that alleges violations of both federal civil service rules and laws prohibiting discrimination. The court sided with Perry, ruling 7 to 2 that he could file his lawsuit in a federal district court instead of first waiting for a federal appeals court to consider part of his case. In dissent, Gorsuch faulted the majority for failing to apply the law as written. \u2018\u2018Anthony Perry asks us to tweak a congressional statute \u2014 just a little \u2014 so that it might (he says) work a bit more efficiently,\u2019\u2019 Gorsuch said, joined by Thomas. \u2018\u2018No doubt his invitation is well meaning. But it\u2019s one we should decline all the same.\u2019\u2019 Later, he added: \u2018\u2018If a statute needs repair, there\u2019s a constitutionally prescribed way to do it,\u2019\u2019 Gorsuch said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s called legislation.\u2019\u2019 A day earlier, Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion when the Supreme Court unanimously limited the government\u2019s ability to strip US citizenship from immigrants who lie during the naturalization process. Joined by Thomas, Gorsuch said the majority ruling was correct, but he argued that following \u2018\u2018the plain text and structure of the statute\u2019\u2019 was enough.", "top_words": ["travel", "case", "courts", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "kennedy", "court", "thomas", "religion", "gorsuch", "federal", "near", "decisions", "law", "church"], "summary": "AdvertisementBut Kennedy turns 81 next month and has been on the court for nearly 30 years.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, could play a pivotal role in both the travel ban and church playground cases.\nThree of those, all involving immigrants or foreigners, were heard by an eight-justice court, before Gorsuch joined the bench in April.\nThe court sided with Perry, ruling 7 to 2 that he could file his lawsuit in a federal district court instead of first waiting for a federal appeals court to consider part of his case.\nJoined by Thomas, Gorsuch said the majority ruling was correct, but he argued that following \u2018\u2018the plain text and structure of the statute\u2019\u2019 was enough.", "source": "bostonglobe", "publish_date": "2017-06-24", "authors": ["mark sherman"], "id": "71", "author_string": "mark sherman"}, {"title": "Gorsuch is already pushing Supreme Court to the right on religion, guns and gays", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-essential-washington-updates-1498693339-htmlstory.html", "text": "When Judge Neil M.

When the case was argued, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year, highlighted the political realities of the opposition to the Medicaid expansion. \u201cIs there any chance that all 26 states opposing it have Republican governors, and all of the states supporting it have Democratic governors?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s a correlation, Justice Scalia,\u201d said Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the states challenging the law, to laughter. On Tuesday, Judge Orrick said the principle established in 2012 applied to the Trump administration\u2019s threat to withhold federal money from localities that refuse to aid efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. \u201cThe Supreme Court concluded that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s threat of denying Medicaid funds, which constituted over 10 percent of the state\u2019s overall budget, was unconstitutionally coercive and represented a \u2018gun to the head,\u2019\u201d Judge Orrick wrote. \u201cThe executive order threatens to deny sanctuary jurisdictions all federal grants, hundreds of millions of dollars on which the counties rely. The threat is unconstitutionally coercive.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump pledged to appeal Judge Orrick\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court, which this month regained a conservative majority with his appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. \u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cSee you in the Supreme Court!\u201d (The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has not ruled in the sanctuary cities case, though it did affirm a ruling blocking Mr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban. Judge Orrick is a district court judge whose decisions may be appealed to the Ninth Circuit.) Though only two California counties had challenged the sanctuary-cities order, Judge Orrick issued a nationwide injunction temporarily blocking it. Here, too, he took a page from what was until recently a Republican litigation playbook. In cases concerning Mr. Obama\u2019s initiatives on immigration and transgender rights, individual judges in Texas concluded that nationwide injunctions blocking them were warranted. Republicans embraced those rulings. Now they are less certain that individual federal judges should be able to wield such power. \u201cOnce again, a single district judge \u2014 this time in San Francisco \u2014 has ignored federal immigration law to set a new immigration policy for the entire country,\u201d the White House said in a statement released Tuesday. Photo Mr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban was also halted by a nationwide injunction, entered by a judge in Seattle, and his revised travel ban was blocked by nationwide injunctions from judges in Maryland and Hawaii. That last order did not sit well with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who criticized Judge Derrick K. Watson of Federal District Court in Honolulu \u2014 \u201ca judge sitting on an island in the Pacific,\u201d as Mr. Sessions put it \u2014 for issuing a ruling that would apply to the whole nation. But Judge Watson relied on a 2015 appeals court ruling blocking Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration program that said such nationwide injunctions were required to ensure uniformity. The court affirmed an injunction issued by a single judge in Brownsville, Tex., who said Mr. Obama had exceeded his authority.

President Trump returned Friday from being feted in France to confront new, damaging revelations in the investigation into whether his associates coordinated with Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election, as well as perilous signs in Congress for the Republican health care bill that represents one of his major campaign pledges. Frustrated and unhappy with how his team has handled the response to the steady drip of damaging information, Trump has reportedly decided to hire Ty Cobb, a longtime Washington lawyer, to manage the White House\u2019s political and legal responses to the Russia investigation. While the White House continues to wrestle with the investigation, Trump\u2019s first major legislative push \u2014 to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u2014 continues to be threatened by seemingly insurmountable Republican divisions. Friday morning, minutes before being welcomed as the guest of honor for the elaborate Bastille Day military parade on the Champs-Elysees, the grand boulevard of Paris, Trump was stewing over his party\u2019s inability to get a bill to his desk. As his motorcade was waiting, he let loose a string of Twitter messages admonishing Senate Republicans, despite the fact that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has told administration officials that such social media messages are not helpful. \u201cAfter all of these years of suffering thru ObamaCare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. Thousands of miles from troubles in Washington, Trump seemed buoyed by his trip to France. He talked animatedly with French President Emmanuel Macron while watching French and American troops, armored personnel carriers, tanks, missile launchers and other military equipment parade for more than two hours from the Arc de Triomphe down the grand avenue. Dozens of military planes and helicopters thundered over the heads of the two presidents, with one formation of fighter jets painting the sky with streaks of red, white and blue smoke signifying the tricolors of both nations. The newly elected Macron had invited Trump on short notice for France\u2019s national day celebrations and to mark the 100th anniversary of American troops\u2019 arrival in France to help fight German forces in World War I. Bands played traditional French marching music. At one point a marching band spelled out the word \"NICE\" in front of the VIP reviewing stand, in memory of 86 people killed a year earlier by an Islamic extremist driving a cargo truck into a Bastille Day celebration in that French city. \u201cThe presence today of the U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife is the sign of a friendship that lasts through time,\u201d Macron said at the conclusion of the parade. France has found \u201csure allies, friends who came to help us,\" he said. \"The United States of America are among them. That is why nothing will separate us, never.\u201d Macron seemed eager to woo Trump personally, and substantively. He focused their meetings Thursday on issues the two administrations can cooperate on, including counter-terrorism and Syria. Macron did not bring up contentious issues such as Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, Trump\u2019s homeland security advisor, Tom Bossert, told reporters flying with the president back to the U.S. Climate issues \u201cdidn\u2019t chill or infect or in any way come up verbally or through nonverbal cues in our conversations,\u201d Bossert said. By the afternoon on Friday, Trump was stepping off Air Force One into the rain, opening a large black umbrella to keep drops off himself and First Lady Melania Trump as they walked to the motorcade taking the couple to Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., for the weekend. He planned to attend the U.S. Women\u2019s Open golf tournament being held there. The last time the president had a rainy weekend in Bedminster he watched television news, fumed, and by his own later account decided to fire FBI Director James B. Comey because of Comey\u2019s pursuit of the Russia investigation. The weather forecast this weekend called for the clouds to part Saturday and the sun to be out all weekend. Trump did find an adoring crowd in Bedminster. Spectators broke the hushed quiet at the golf tournament when Trump came to the windows of a viewing area multiple times to wave to the crowd near the course\u2019s 15th hole. Tournament organizers encouraged the crowd to keep their voices down for golfers playing through the drizzle on a nearby green.

The court offered limited examples, including students, \u201ca worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.\u201d In guidelines issued Thursday, the Trump administration interpreted the order to allow entry of people with \"close family\u201d in the U.S., such as a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling or in-law parents. It said people with employment and university admission would also qualify. But it blocked grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers- and sisters-in-law. That set the stage for a legal showdown over who qualifies as close family. Late Thursday, the state of Hawaii filed a motion in Honolulu\u2019s federal district court asking a judge who previously ruled against the travel ban to clarify whether the government\u2019s list of unqualified relatives violates the Supreme Court\u2019s order. Government officials said they based their interpretation on the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. But Kevin Lapp, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the closest that law comes to defining \"close family\" is a section that describes \"immediate relatives\" as children younger than 21, spouses and parents. Those relatives get preference for visas, and the government went beyond that definition with the travel ban rules, he said. Peter Spiro, a law professor at Temple University, said that \u201cthe administration\u2019s definition of family is all over the place.\u201d He pointed out that the immigration act doesn't allow preferential treatment for mothers- and fathers-in-law \u2014 who were included in the administration\u2019s definition of close relatives \u2014 but does give preference to fiances and fiancees \u2014 who were initially left off the list and then added in the final hour before the ban took effect. Caught in the confusion was U.S. citizen Afsaneh Shirazi, a 36-year-old software engineer who lives in San Francisco, whose fiance has been in Iran since November waiting for a visa. Before the last-minute change, the couple had been thinking about moving to another country to be together. \u201cIt was a hard day and I am a bit relieved now,\u201d she said after it appeared her fiance would not be barred. \u201cI am still worried about administrative processing taking a long time.\u201d The policy on refugees is another source of confusion. Refugees scheduled to arrive in the U.S. by July 6 will still be allowed entry. But it was unclear how the order would be applied to thousands of refugees who had been approved for travel but could not get flight reservations before that deadline. Refugee advocates argue that refugee agencies should be counted as bona fide U.S. connections, allowing resettlement to proceed. But the Trump administration said a refugee\u2019s relationship with a resettlement group by itself was not enough. \"Our understanding is that they are essentially shutting down refugee resettlement,\u201d said Justin Cox, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. \u201c... If we can't work this out, we will be back in court.\u201d Cox is among a team representing immigrants and refugee groups in a case over the travel ban that the Supreme Court is expected to hear in the fall. The court, which is also considering a similar case from Hawaii, indicated that its move to partially revive the ban was a temporary compromise before it heard full arguments. Plaintiffs have argued that the ban unconstitutionally discriminates against Muslims. But the matter could be moot by the fall, because Trump\u2019s executive order says the government needs 90 days to evaluate its vetting procedures before offering permanent proposals to hinder entry from terrorists. Amid questions about who would be let into the U.S., immigrant advocates dispatched volunteers overnight Thursday to international airports in Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York, Washington and other cities. \"You have kids out of school who expected to see their grandparents this summer,\u201d said Camille Mackler, director of legal initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition, who was stationed at John F. Kennedy International Airport. \u201cYou have U.S. citizens who were planning to get married and can\u2019t bring over their fiances.\u201d Mackler said she didn\u2019t expect a repeat of the \u201cdramatic scene\u201d that occurred in January when the original ban led to several days of deportations, detentions and thousands of visa cancellations before it was struck down in court. The chaos led to dozens of lawsuits and months of rants from the president against district and circuit courts that ruled against him. Trump administration officials said that people who had visa appointments at embassies and consulates should still apply for travel and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. They also said consular officials, as before, would have the ability to waive restrictions in individual cases. Immigrant groups have continued to register their opposition to the ban. The National Iranian American Council said its implementation represented a \u201cnew low\u201d by \u201ctargeting grandparents of American children.\u201d", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "authors": ["jaweed kaleem"], "type": "article", "id": 190, "author_string": "jaweed kaleem"}, {"title": "A Pakistani Christian family is scheduled to arrive in the U.S. next week as refugees. Will they be allowed to stay?", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-travel-ban-refugees-20170628-story.html", "text": "Since being approved two weeks ago to fly to the United States as a refugee, Shaz Sadiq has read her Bible and prayed nightly that nothing goes wrong. She fled her native Pakistan \u2014 where her father had been killed in a church shooting and she had received frequent death threats \u2014 in 2013 and has spent the last four years in Bangkok, Thailand, applying for refugee status and permanent resettlement in a place safe for Christians. \u201cEvery day is a miracle. And every day feels like a year,\u201d said Sadiq, 42, who is scheduled to arrive at Washington Dulles International Airport the afternoon of July 6 with her sister and mother. Sadiq, who has no relatives in the United States and has never been in the country, could be among the last refugees of her kind admitted to the U.S. \u2014 at least for a while \u2014 now that the Supreme Court has revived President Trump\u2019s travel ban. With exceptions for people with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d to schools, employers, family or other U.S. entities, the ban going into effect Thursday will block admissions of people from six majority-Muslim countries for 90 days as the government evaluates its vetting procedures. Pakistan is not on that list. But the travel order also bans refugees from all countries for 120 days. Advocates for immigrants and refugees have been struggling to interpret the court\u2019s less-than-clear language on who is exempt from the new travel rules and say that the federal government has caused confusion by not releasing guidelines on which refugees it will accept. The State Department is studying how to define \u201cbona fide relationship,\u201d spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this week. Refugees already en route \u2014 whether they have a bona fide relationship to the U.S. or not \u2014 would be allowed into the U.S. through July 6. \u201cBeyond that, we don't know,\u201d Nauert said. Sadiq said she\u2019s confident she and her family members will be able to start their new lives. She hopes to find work as a translator, her profession in Pakistan. \u201cThis restriction is not for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will make it.\u201d But a representative of the resettlement agency helping her family, the International Rescue Committee, said he\u2019s less sure because her scheduled arrival comes at the brink of the deadline. A small delay on either of her two flights could push her over. \u201cI\u2019m not confident this family will make it in,\u201d said Ruben Chandrasekar, a regional director for the organization in the Washington, D.C., area. \u201cA lot will depend on the exact guidance we get from the State Department,\u201d he said. We are friendly, polite women. We want to live our own lives. We are not going to be a bother. \u2014 Shaz Sadiq Sadiq is being resettled with his office because she knows an employee of the organization in the Washington area for whom she did translation work in Pakistan. But that kind of relationship may not be enough to pass government muster should she arrive late or local officials decide to apply their own discretion, Chandrasekar said. \u201cThis family has no family member connection in the area, so that also makes it harder to make a case if we have to,\u201d he said. About 40% of refugees in the U.S. arrive with no family in the country. And because of their status as refugees, they tend to not have the kind of job or university connection other immigrants could use to bypass the ban. Refugee groups have argued that people who have been connected to resettlement agencies in the U.S. \u2014 a requirement to resettle \u2014 should be able to count those agencies as U.S. connections for travel purposes. People with bona fide ties should include \u201canyone who has an existing relationship with a nonprofit, frankly tens of thousands of refugees,\u201d said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. The organization is among those whose lawsuit against the travel ban the Supreme Court will consider in the fall. But the State Department, the main federal agency that handles refugee resettlement, hasn\u2019t weighed in on that question. On Thursday, Muslim Advocates, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Americans United for Separation of Church and State \u2014 all opponents of the travel ban \u2014 sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly asking for \u201cimmediate guidance\u201d on how it will be implemented. Justin Cox, an attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, questioned whether immigration authorities are receiving clear guidance. \u201cIf they are violating what the Supreme Court said, we can and will go back to the courts,\u201d he said. Advocates are hoping for a smoother rollout of the travel ban than what happened with the original version of the ban, which included green card holders being blocked and tens of thousands of visas being canceled amid confusion at U.S. airports and embassies across the world. That ban included a preference for refugees who were religious minorities in their countries, including Christians such as Sadiq. Though Sadiq, her sister, Rahila, and their mother, Doris, passed a vetting process that took years, they plan to celebrate only after passing customs agents and stepping foot on American soil. \u201cOur heart is dead with so many things,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have excitement. Maybe we will once we get to America.\u201d She said she hopes that anti-immigrant views in the U.S. won\u2019t affect her family. \u201cIf you have a guest in your house and the guest does not follow the rules, you have to understand if the guest has problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are not troublemakers. We are friendly, polite women. We want to live our own lives. We are not going to be a bother.\u201d CAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.

In the first major foreign policy address of his presidency, Trump also made clear that his administration would break with the two previous occupants of the White House by not promoting human rights or democratic reforms in a region rife with rigidly controlled societies. \u201cWe are not here to lecture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship.\u201d Yet his speech was notable for putting the onus on his audience \u2014 the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations packed in an ornate hall under giant glittering chandeliers \u2014 to \u201ctake the lead in combating radicalization\u201d and to \u201ctake on the burden\u201d of battling terrorism. Marrying his stated \u201cAmerica first\u201d credo with his vow to eradicate Islamic State and other terrorist networks, Trump said nations in the Middle East \u201ccannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them\u201d and must plot their own course. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between two futures, and it\u2019s a choice America cannot make for you,\u201d he said. \u201cDrive them out. Drive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. And drive them out of this earth.\u201d He also took a carefully veiled swipe at Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Muslim countries that, at least in the past, turned a blind eye to radical clerics and others who raised money or recruited for extremist groups. \u201cThere can be no coexistence with this violence,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it.\u201d He said America seeks \u201cpartners, not perfection\u201d to pursue peace and security in the region. Invoking God eight separate times, the president also preached the virtues of religious tolerance for followers of all faiths. Trump\u2019s aides had portrayed the speech as a rebuttal in some ways to President Obama\u2019s attempts to open bridges to the Islamic world in a famous speech in Cairo in June 2009. In that speech, Obama called for a \u201cnew beginning\u201d in U.S. relations with Muslim nations. Noting that he was raised in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, Obama said he felt the need to fight \"negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.\" Trump\u2019s rhetoric Sunday was chiefly notable for its stunning contrast with his regular demonization of Muslims on the campaign trail last year. Back then, he repeatedly warned \u201cIslam hates us\u201d and called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d As president, he has issued two orders seeking to bar most travel from select Muslim-majority nations; federal judges have blocked both because of what they say appears to be an anti-Muslim motivation. Trump ended his comments with a harsh denunciation of Iran, a common enemy for most of the Sunni Arab leaders, who listened to his remarks through translation devices. He did not acknowledge Iran\u2019s peaceful election Friday, which rejected a hard-line Shiite cleric and returned reformist President Hassan Rouhani to office in a landslide. In contrast, most of the Gulf Arab states are monarchies, and few Arab nations hold regular elections. \u201cUntil the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve,\u201d Trump said. A senior White House official told reporters later that \"an emboldened Iran has united the Arab world in a very unique way.\" \"They are working together extremely cooperatively, and also frankly, cooperating incredibly well with Israel,\" the official said. Trump will arrive in Israel on Monday morning, his second stop on his trip. His remarks Sunday to an Arab-Islamic-American summit hosted by the Saudi king were the capstone of a dizzying second day of an eight-day marathon to the Middle East and Europe. After an elaborate welcome fit for a king on Saturday, he began Sunday with a succession of one-on-one meetings with kings, presidents and emirs from the Gulf region before turning to the two broader gatherings of regional leaders. Ahead of a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, its six member nations and the U.S. outlined new commitments to move against terrorist financing. Later Sunday, Trump helped Saudi King Salman open a new center for monitoring and combating global terrorism. Trump\u2019s speech was drafted by Stephen Miller, a White House senior policy advisor who had helped write Trump\u2019s now-stalled travel ban. The speech later was revised with input from Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his national security advisor, H.R. McMaster. During the campaign last year, Trump attacked Obama for refusing to describe terrorist threats as \u201cradical Islamic extremism.\u201d Obama and his defenders said the term would anger Muslim nations and feed terrorism propaganda that claims America is at war with Islam. In his speech Sunday, Trump misstated the term twice. An aide said later the president garbled the language because he was \"just an exhausted guy.\" It didn\u2019t seem to matter. At least outwardly, key regional leaders were eager to praise Trump for his leadership and in several cases invite him to visit their countries. The emir of Kuwait called the president \u201cBrother Trump,\u201d and said he hoped to welcome him one day to the tiny country that a U.S.-led coalition liberated from Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi likewise expressed hope that Trump would visit his country \u2014 an invitation Trump seemed more eager to accept \u2014 while praising the president as \u201ca unique personality who is capable of the impossible.\u201d \u201cI agree,\u201d Trump responded. Meeting with the emir of Qatar, Trump said they would discuss \u201cthe purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment, because nobody makes it like the United States.\u201d \u201cBravo President Trump,\u201d tweeted Anwar Gargash, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 foreign minister, who said the speech defined an \u201capproach toward extremism and terrorism with candid respect and friendship.\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s role reaffirmed,\u201d he wrote in another tweet. But many Muslims, especially those outside the Gulf states, were less enthusiastic. The Palestinian group Hamas, which holds sway over the Gaza Strip, condemned Trump\u2019s words as a \u201cslander against the reputation of the resistance of the [Palestinian] people.\u201d In his address, Trump had lumped Hamas along with Islamic State and Al Qaeda as terrorist groups.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-05-22", "authors": ["michael a. memoli"], "type": "article", "id": 70, "author_string": "michael a. memoli"}, {"source": "chicagotribune", "title": "At the nation's only Latino mosque, Trump's immigration policies have 'changed everything'", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-latino-muslims-2017-story.html", "text": "Sitting recently in his office in a converted bank across from a suburban strip mall, Isa Parada methodically thumbed through scripture as he recalled the contrasting moments of his first month leading one of the city\u2019s newest and most unusual houses of worship. There was the undocumented Mexican congregant who was arrested by immigration officers, leaving his wife and child behind. There was the Syrian American worshiper who wondered after the president\u2019s travel ban if she'd ever see her relatives again. There was the young Mexican American near tears after he converted to join the congregation, part of a stream of newcomers. There were the emails and calls thanking Parada for being there at a time when the country\u2019s leader broadly painted immigrants and Muslims as being prone to violence. Todd Spoth / For The Times Imam Isa Parada of Centro Isl\u00e1mico mosque in Houston. Imam Isa Parada of Centro Isl\u00e1mico mosque in Houston. (Todd Spoth / For The Times) \"Man, he\u2019s changed everything,\" Parada, a stocky, bearded Salvadoran American, said of President Trump. \u201cIn some ways, he\u2019s turned our world upside-down.\u201d Last month, Parada became the first full-time imam at Centro Isl\u00e1mico, the nation's only Spanish-speaking mosque. The congregation, which counts among it dozens of Mexican Americans and other converts, serves one of the fastest growing segments of Islam in the U.S.: Latinos. Now, with the president\u2019s sweeping immigration changes through his travel ban and deportation push, those at Centro Isl\u00e1mico have been affected in ways few imagined when it launched just over a year ago on the far western edge of Houston. They\u2019ve also come to play a unique role as a bridge between the nation\u2019s Muslims and Latinos, two groups in the crosshairs of some of the most controversial administration moves. Representatives of both have taken to the streets and courts to battle the White House. \u201cWhat I try to tell people is that Donald Trump becoming president for us is giving us more confidence as Latino Muslims. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to talk about Islam, to talk about our immigrant stories,\u201d said Parada, 39. \u201cBut we also have to be realistic. You hope it never gets back to what happened to the Japanese.\u201d According to the Pew Research Center, there are more than 100,000 Latino Muslims in the U.S. They make up a sliver of the nation\u2019s 3.3 million Muslims and a smaller portion of its 57 million Latinos. They\u2019re concentrated in areas with large Latino populations such as California, Texas, Florida and New Jersey. But the heart of the community is Houston, where occasional Spanish-language services have taken place at traditional mosques for years under the guidance of Islam in Spanish, an educational nonprofit that largely focused on producing online videos and distributing Spanish-language Korans \u2014 until it launched Centro Isl\u00e1mico.

(Todd Spoth / For The Times) Here, the Muslims are immigrants and those born in the U.S. to parents who crossed the border, as well as people whose families trace their lineage south of the Rio Grande but have lived in the U.S. for generations. The mosque spans 5,000 square feet, including a prayer hall, social room, gift shop, a small exhibit on Islamic history and a studio where sermons and classes are streamed online. A white concrete building with dark, tinted windows, it comes to life inside where walls are decorated with red and white striped patterns reminiscent of the Mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba, the famed 10th century Spanish mosque. Arab Muslims ruled Spain for centuries beginning in the Middle Ages, leaving an Islamic influence on culture and language that remains today. It\u2019s a legacy the center\u2019s Muslims point to as part of their shared history. The Latino Muslim community in Houston now tops 1,000 Muslims. Dozens show up for Friday congregational prayers, and hundreds come for holiday services at Centro Isl\u00e1mico. Trump\u2019s name has been said perhaps only less than Allah\u2019s and the prophet Muhammad\u2019s at the mosque since its grand opening \u2014 and has become a constant if silent backdrop to part-English, part-Spanish sermons. But only recently has the president had a measurable impact as his campaign promises turned into policy. After Trump signed his first executive order pausing refugee resettlement and travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, concerns grew among women married to Middle Eastern and African Muslim men.

(Todd Spoth / For The Times) Some in the community rallied at Houston\u2019s airport as travelers were detained in a shaky first rollout of the travel ban. Others headed to Austin last month for \u201cTexas Muslim Capitol Day\u201d to plead with lawmakers to aid Muslims such as those whose mosque in Victoria, two hours from Houston, burned to the ground in January. When the Department of Homeland Security announced it would make it easier for immigration agents to arrest and deport those living in the country illegally, stories spread at Centro Isl\u00e1mico of traffic checkpoints and raids at grocery stores. One man is in proceedings to be deported to Mexico. Younger members who are \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 people who enrolled in a program under President Obama that halted deportations of certain immigrants brought to the country as children \u2014 are praying their status continues. It\u2019s hard to be as \u201cstrange and different\u201d as Latino Muslims, Parada \u2014 who converted 21 years ago from Catholicism after reading about Malcolm X \u2014 told a few dozen congregants during a recent sermon. It\u2019s hard, he said, to be asked by relatives why he doesn\u2019t drink anymore, or be looked at by uncles as if \u201csomething is not normal with you.\u201d \u201cBut Allah knows this \u2014 he is watching and knows everything \u2014 Islam began as something strange,\u201d he said, telling the crowd to be patient with their friends and relatives, and with the nation. The Latinos in the room could be an example to the city and their workplaces, Parada said, of how in Islam \u201cwomen are equal to men,\u201d of how Islam is a faith of peace and justice. Afterward, members lingered in a hallway to commiserate over the their place in America. They encouraged each other to be steadfast in faith and spirit. They were newer Muslims, ones who long ago converted from Christianity, and those born into the religion.

This provision suspends all admissions of refugees, not limited to the seven countries.

Schneiderman, sent a letter to federal officials Sunday demanding information about those held at John F. Kennedy International Airport after receiving what he called \u201calarming reports\u201d that the federal government was planning to violate the court order. In an interview, Mr. Schneiderman said that the executive order was unconstitutional and that he and other attorneys general were exploring the possibility of legal action. \u201cThere may be grounds for a claim that this does damage to a state, if they\u2019re damaging our state institutions\u201d like universities and hospitals, he said. The president has broad power to control immigration. A federal law allows him to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants\u201d if he determines that their entry \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d But another law appears to limit that power, saying that \u201cno person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\u201d Saturday\u2019s court orders, issued in haste, contained little reasoning. Judge Donnelly, in Brooklyn, wrote that there was a strong likelihood that the two plaintiffs in the case, who seek to represent a class of refugees, visa holders and others, could establish that their removal would violate the Constitution\u2019s due process and equal protection guarantees. Based on that conclusion and the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d the plaintiffs would suffer, Judge Donnelly issued a temporary nationwide injunction barring their removal. She did not order their release. The order in Boston, from Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the Federal District Court there, was in one sense broader and in another narrower. It limited border screening practices to those in place before Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, and it barred not only removal but also detention. But it seemed to be limited to people arriving or held at Logan International Airport there. The order from Judge Leonie M. Brinkema of the Federal District Court in Alexandria applied only to legal permanent residents being held at Dulles International Airport. The order in Seattle, from Judge Thomas S. Zilly of the Federal District Court there, applied to two plaintiffs.

But the cases were filed very quickly, and civil rights litigators generally like to locate ideal plaintiffs and hone their legal theories before filing test cases that could turn into legal landmarks. The Brooklyn case, for instance, did not make a claim based on the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of government establishment of religion, though some lawyers said that was the executive order\u2019s central flaw. \u201cThe smoking gun they put in the executive order is the idea that they would grant exceptions for minority religions,\u201d Mr. Romero said. Mr. Trump has said that was meant to favor Christians over Muslims.

Bush, said at one point. \"I have trouble understanding where we're supposed to infer religious animus,\" said Clifton.

Legal filings hint at the broad constitutional and statutory arguments to come, but judges have not yet ruled squarely on the merits one way or the other. The challenges began a week ago when individuals with valid visas, among others, found themselves in legal limbo. They were in transit when Trump's order went into effect on the evening of January 27 and they were not immediately allowed into the country. Now several states are also bringing claims, including Washington, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Hawaii among others. The claim brought by attorneys general in Washington and Minnesota -- the one that led federal Judge James Robart in Seattle to put a temporary nationwide halt to the travel ban Friday night -- is the furthest along so far, but the legal landscape changes quickly. Trump's order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Standing In order to bring suit, states must prove that they have been harmed. In court papers, attorneys general for Washington and Minnesota argue they have the legal right to be in court. \"Washington has declared that practices that discriminate against any of its inhabitants because of race, creed, color or national origin are matters of public concern that threaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public welfare,\" they wrote. They also claim the executive order would hurt the state's economy, pointing to Microsoft, which is headquartered in the state. \"Microsoft's US workforce is heavily dependent on immigrants and guest workers,\" they write. \"At least 76 employees at Microsoft are citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya or Yemen and hold temporary work visas.\" Minnesota stresses that the order would impact the Mayo Clinic that is based there. \"The Mayo Clinic, an internationally known health care institution that treats patients who travel to it for health care services from around the world, has publicly stated that approximately 80 staff, physicians and scholars have ties to the affected countries.\" The government says the states don't have the right to be in court, and on the threshold issue, government lawyers say the states are attempting to manufacture standing. In court papers, lawyers for the government argue that \"lost tax revenues, or reputational injury to its universities -- are not concrete, particularized harms.\" And the lawyers say that the states can't rely on any injuries to lawful permanent residents because the White House has clarified that the 90-day suspension of entry does not apply to those individuals. \"In effect, the states are arguing that, unlike individuals temporarily detained at the airport, they will suffer a longer-term economic injury from the executive order -- one that therefore allows them to challenge it,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. \"This is a controversial argument, but, more than a little ironically, it's based on similar reasoning to what a number of more conservative states, led by Texas, successfully used in the lower courts to challenge President Obama's deferred action immigration program,\" he said. Constitutional and statutory arguments Moving to the merits, the states make a variety of statutory and constitutional arguments. Washington and Minnesota argue that the executive orders \"target individuals for discriminatory treatment based on their country of origin and/or religion, without lawful justification\" and they say the order was \"motivated by animus and a desire to harm a particular group.\" They also say that the order violates the Establishment Clause that prohibits the federal government from preferring one religion over another. They say parts of the order, coupled with some statements made by the President in the press, \"are intended to disfavor Islam and favor Christianity.\" And they make a due process claim arguing that the federal government cannot deprive individuals based on their liberty interests without due process of the law. Also in play is the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which they argue \"prohibits discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas on the basis of race, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin echoed these arguments in a different case. He argues the executive order \"is subjecting a portion of Hawaii's population to discrimination and second-class treatment, and denying them their fundamental right to travel overseas. Moreover, the executive order is eroding Hawaii's sovereign interests in maintaining the separation between church and state and in welcoming persons from all nations around the world into the fabric of its society.\" \"There are so many different legal objections to the executive order -- and so many different changes in policy in the order -- that it's hard to know which ones will stick,\" said Vladeck. \"The whole order is potentially vulnerable to the religious discrimination claims, whereas the due process objections are more to how individual sections of the order restrict the liberty of different classes of immigrants. But there's almost no way the entire order survives these lawsuits unscathed,\" he said. In the hours after Robart issued the nationwide order blocking the ban, Trump was quick to respond. \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" Trump tweeted Saturday morning. The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 In court papers, his lawyers have so far been more measured. On the merits, they note that Congress \"expressly has delegated to the President the broad power to suspend entry 'of any class of aliens into the United States.' \" \"The order was well within the President's authority under Congress' delegation, particularly in an area, like immigration, in which the admission to the United States of foreign aliens is subject to plenary control by the political branches,\" they said. Courts In issuing his temporary restraining order, Robart, the US district judge for the western district of Washington, acknowledged that issuing it is \"an extraordinary remedy\" but he held that the executive order \"adversely affects the states' residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom of travel.\" He said the harms are \"significant and ongoing,\" and concluded that the order against the government was necessary until the court could hear arguments for further relief. His order came after a different judge in Massachusetts declined to renew a temporary restraining order previously issued. Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts said one of the factors he had to consider was whether the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits. \"Because plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, an extension of the restraining order at the present time is not warranted,\" he said.", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "challenges", "different", "ban", "judge", "court", "states", "trumps", "say", "order", "arguments", "washington", "legal"], "summary": "The challenges began a week ago when individuals with valid visas, among others, found themselves in legal limbo.\nThey also claim the executive order would hurt the state's economy, pointing to Microsoft, which is headquartered in the state.\nHe argues the executive order \"is subjecting a portion of Hawaii's population to discrimination and second-class treatment, and denying them their fundamental right to travel overseas.\n\"There are so many different legal objections to the executive order -- and so many different changes in policy in the order -- that it's hard to know which ones will stick,\" said Vladeck.\nHis order came after a different judge in Massachusetts declined to renew a temporary restraining order previously issued.", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-02-04", "authors": ["ariane de vogue"], "id": "212", "author_string": "ariane de vogue"}, {"title": "Donald Trump's tweets are helping fight his travel ban", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/15/politics/trump-twitter-travel-ban/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) Justice Department attorney Michelle Bennett learned firsthand Monday what it feels like to have a tweet written by the President of the United States used against her in federal court. Bennett was asking district court Judge James Robart to temporarily postpone proceedings concerning the President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration while a federal appeals court was still considering the issue. In response, Robart brought up Trump's tweet sent after the appeals court ruled against the White House last week. \"SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\" Trump tweeted in all caps. \"Counsel, I'm a little surprised,\" Robart told Bennett as she made her request for postponement, \"since the President said he wanted to 'see you in Court'....Are you confident that's the argument you want to make?\" \"Yes, your honor\" Bennett said. Robart ultimately ruled against her. To be sure, Robart's comment was lighthearted, but it reflects the facts that judges are not immune to a series of tweets the President has launched about the case, often criticizing the judiciary and particular judges. Courts are also looking at other statements Trump has made that could directly impact the defense of his travel ban. Indeed, less than four weeks into his administration Trump's outbursts might serve not only to complicate the arguments made by government lawyers but also jeopardize the future of his executive order on immigration. A key part of the argument against the travel ban, for instance, is that it discriminates on the basis of religion. It is something the government lawyers have flatly rejected, but the courts -- so far -- are taking seriously. \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\" Trump wrote in a statement last month. \"This is not about religion\u2014this is about terror and keeping our country safe,\" he said. But in almost every brief filed, the challengers have carefully detailed the comments Trump made during the campaign and afterwards that they argue prove that there was an intent to discriminate. And the argument seems to be resonating with some judges -- although the challenge is still at a preliminary stage. Trump's executive order bars citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. During one hearing when Washington State Solicitor General Noah Purcell was asked about whether the ban inferred \"religious animus,\" Purcell pounced. \"The case law from this court and the Supreme Court is very clear that to prove religious discrimination, we do not need to prove that this order harms only Muslims, or that it harms every Muslim. We just need to prove that it was motivated in part by a desire to harm Muslims,\" he said. He went on to tell the court that although the states haven't had any discovery, they have come across \"rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate\" including public statements from the President. Purcell outlined examples in court briefs of Trump's statements including one he made when he was a candidate on December 7, 2015 when he issued a press release calling for a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" When the 9th Circuit panel eventually ruled in favor of Purcell, it did so on due process grounds but the judges mentioned the religious claims and wrote: \"It is well established that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims.\" \"There is no question that President Trump's order is not an explicit ban on all Muslims,\" said Kari E. Hong a professor at Boston College Law School who has signed a brief in support of the states challenging the ban: Washington and Minnesota. \"But the courts have long recognized that government officials with prejudice often are savvy enough to hide their intent behind words that seem neutral,\" she said. \"That is why statements that President Trump and his top advisors made in public, to one another, and even in tweets, will be central to determining what in fact was the purpose of the ban.\" In a different case on Monday night, Judge Leonie Brinkema, of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia noted that the Commonwealth has produced \"unrebutted evidence\" supporting its position that it is likely to succeed on its claim that the ban was a violation of the Establishment Clause. \"The 'Muslim ban' was a center piece of the president's campaign for months, and the press release calling for it was still available on his website as of the day this Memorandum Opinion is being entered,\" she wrote. In a new lawsuit filed in Maryland the National Immigration Law Center argues that the executive order was \"intended and designed to target and discriminate against Muslims.\" The lawyers maintain \"rarely in American history has governmental intent to discriminate against a particular faith and its adherents been so plain.\" They point to a July 2016 interview on NBC's Meet the Press. \"Candidate Trump was asked if a plan similar to the now-enacted Executive Order was a 'roll back' from the 'Muslim ban,\" the lawyers wrote. \"Candidate Trump responded: 'I don't think so. I actually don't think it's a rollback. In fact, you could say it's an expansion. I'm looking now at territories,'\" they wrote. \"Candidate Trump continued, 'People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can't use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I'm okay with that, because I'm talking territory instead of Muslim.'\" They also provided comments that former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Trump supporter, made on Fox News last month. \"When [candidate Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.\" He called me up. He said, \"put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\" Not all judges reference Trump's statements, however, US District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ruled in favor of Trump and declined to extend a temporary restraining order. Of the Establishment Clause claims he said simply, that at least in one section of the Executive Order is \"neutral with respect to religion.\" And Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, believes \"it is highly questionable that courts can or will consider evidence of any kind about the motivations behind the President's actions.\" He cites federal law that provides that the President can 'suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants' and said, \"that does not empower courts to second-guess his reasons.\" McConnell also argues that \"A candidate is not the government. Candidate Trump advocated a Muslim ban, but the executive order is not a Muslim Ban. Is the government of the United States precluded from taking what would otherwise be legitimate steps to screen out applicants from nations where it is difficult to vet their applications, because a candidate said something outrageous on the campaign trail?\"", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "tweets", "trump", "fight", "ban", "court", "donald", "helping", "trumps", "president", "order", "muslim", "law", "district"], "summary": "Bennett was asking district court Judge James Robart to temporarily postpone proceedings concerning the President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration while a federal appeals court was still considering the issue.\n\"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\" Trump wrote in a statement last month.\nTrump's executive order bars citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.\nOf the Establishment Clause claims he said simply, that at least in one section of the Executive Order is \"neutral with respect to religion.\"\nCandidate Trump advocated a Muslim ban, but the executive order is not a Muslim Ban.", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-02-15", "authors": ["ariane de vogue"], "id": "266", "author_string": "ariane de vogue"}, {"title": "Trump's DOJ lays out travel ban defense", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/05/politics/donald-trump-executive-order-justice-department/index.html", "text": "(CNN) Top Justice Department lawyers are now in charge of defending the Trump administration's hastily drawn up executive order, and they are assiduously avoiding President Donald Trump's blunt and inflammatory tweets in favor of sweeping and bold statements about national security and executive power.

The lawyers' language is in stark contrast to that of the President, who tweeted Saturday: \"The judge opens our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!\" The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 Standing The first line of attack in the 30-page brief centers on whether the two states involved, Washington and Minnesota, have the legal right to be in court. It's a threshold issue -- called \"standing\" -- but courts take it very seriously. A state has to prove that it has been harmed in order to bring the challenge. Noel J. Francisco, the acting-solicitor general who signed the brief, quotes precedent and stresses it is \"no part\" of a state's \"duty or power\" to enforce its citizens' rights in respect of their relations with the federal government. Francisco dismisses one argument put forward by Washington -- that its public universities will be harmed by the executive order-- noting that \"most if not all of the students and faculty members the state identifies are not prohibited from entering the United States.\" He argues the state's arguments are not good enough because they have \"identified only speculative harms it would suffer from temporary suspension of the entry of aliens affected by the order.\" He then turns to the President's power in the area of immigration. Again quoting precedent, he writes that the President's authority in the area \"is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\" JUST WATCHED DOJ files appeal to travel ban suspension Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH DOJ files appeal to travel ban suspension 01:15 \"Apparently, on the government's view, the order is directed at non-citizens with no meaningful constitutional rights, and any impact on those with substantial ties to the United States is incidental,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. \"But given the special relief the government lawyers are seeking, it's not clear they've done enough to show that they are harmed by the district court's order to anywhere near the same degree as immigrants from these seven countries are harmed by the executive order,\" he said. Key to the argument is the President's role when it comes to national security. \"Unlike the President, courts do not have access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations, the efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the United States, or gaps in the vetting process,\" Francisco's brief says. While the states argued that the order discriminates based on religion, Francisco insists the order \"does not favor Christian refugees at the expense of Muslims, but rather is neutral with respect to religion.\" The final thrust in the brief is that what the lower court did by blocking the order nationwide boils down to \"judicial second guessing.\" \"Judicial second-guessing of the President's determination that a temporary suspension of entry of certain classes of aliens was necessary at this time to protect national security would constitute an impermissible intrusion on the political branches' plenary constitutional authority over foreign affairs, national security, and immigration,\" Francisco writes.", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "lawyers", "courts", "national", "ban", "brief", "suspension", "defense", "doj", "trumps", "states", "harmed", "lays", "order", "presidents"], "summary": "Then a three-judge panel will decide whether to schedule a hearing or issue a ruling.\nJustice Department lawyers face an uphill battle to vacate the lower court's order, but in making their arguments, they've laid out a broad defense that will replay in other upcoming challenges.\nThe judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart.\nA state has to prove that it has been harmed in order to bring the challenge.\nThe final thrust in the brief is that what the lower court did by blocking the order nationwide boils down to \"judicial second guessing.\"", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "authors": ["ariane de vogue"], "id": "217", "author_string": "ariane de vogue"}, {"title": "Travel ban case: Here's what the Supreme Court might look at", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/25/politics/travel-ban-case-supreme-court-analysis/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) The next stop in the legal challenge over the Trump administration's travel ban against people from six Muslim-majority countries may be the Supreme Court. Thursday, in rejecting the travel ban, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals zeroed in on the comments Donald Trump as a candidate and president, the government's national security justifications, and the role of the courts. But while the majority said the travel ban \"drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination,\" the dissenters focused keenly on how the Supreme Court might view the case differently. Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to \"seek review\" of the case at the Supreme Court. \"This opinion relies on principles that should be exceptionally persuasive to the Supreme Court,\" said Joshua A. Matz, who filed a brief in support of the challengers, \"though, of course, it is possible that the justices will see things differently than the lower court.\" Here's key parts of the 4th Circuit ruling the justices could review: Scathing account of the purpose of the order \"Surely the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment yet stands as an untiring sentinel for the protection of one of our most cherished founding principles -- that government shall not establish any religious orthodoxy, or favor or disfavor one religion over another. Congress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute. It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the President wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation.\" \"The evidence in the record, viewed from the standpoint of the reasonable observer, creates a compelling case that the (Executive Order's) primary purpose is religious. Then-candidate Trump's campaign statements reveal that on numerous occasions, he expressed anti-Muslim sentiment, as well as his intent, if elected, to ban Muslims from the United States.\" Over several pages the majority walked through comments made by Trump and his advisers during the campaign and explained why they should be taken into consideration. The majority conceded that campaign statements \"may not reveal all that much about a government actor's purposes\" but added, \"The campaign statements here are probative of purpose because they are closely related in time, attributable to the primary decisionmaker, and specific and easily connected to the challenged action.\" \"We need not probe anyone's heart of hearts to discover the purpose ... or President Trump and his aides have explained it on numerous occasions and in no uncertain terms.\" But how far is too far in using Trump's statements? Three judges all appointed by Republican presidents filed three separate dissents, each joining the other. Judge Paul V. Niemeyer suggested that the Supreme Court will not buy into the use of Trump's campaign statements. He wrote that the majority \"looks past the face\" of the order and instead considers campaign statements. He said that the approach \"adopts a new rule of law that uses campaign statements to recast the plain, unambiguous, and religiously neutral text.\" He warned that \"opening the door to the use of campaign statements to inform the text of later executive orders has no rational limits.\" \"Unless corrected by the Supreme Court, the majority's new approach, which is unsupported by any Supreme Court case, will become a sword for plaintiffs to challenge facially neutral government actions, particularly those affecting regions dominated by a single religion,\" he said. Justified by national security? The majority expressed skepticism that the national security justifications were convincing. \"Our inquiry,\" the court said \"is one of balance, and on balance, we cannot say that the government's asserted national security interest outweighs the competing harms to plaintiffs.\" \"These cases recognize that when we protect the constitutional rights of the few, it inures to the benefit of all. And even more so here, where the constitutional violation injures plaintiffs and in the process permeates and ripples across entire religious groups, communities and society at large.\" Some of the most searing language came from Judge James A. Wynn, a Barack Obama nominee, who wrote separately to say he would have gone further than the majority by holding that the ban likely violates the Constitution as well as federal law. \"Invidious discrimination that is shrouded in layers of legality is no less an insult to our Constitution than naked invidious discrimination,\" Wynn said. \"Laid bare,\" he said, \"the order is no more than what the President promised before and after his election: naked invidious discrimination against Muslims.\" Wynn said such action \"contravenes the authority Congress delegated to the President in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Executive power Wynn agreed with his colleagues in the majority that the Court should not \"blindly defer\" to executive action, all in the name of the Constitution's separation of powers.\" \"We decline to do so, not only because it is the particular province of the judicial branch to say what the law is, but also because we would do a disservice to our constitutional structure were we to let its mere invocation silence the call for meaningful judicial review.\"", "top_words": ["heres", "travel", "case", "purpose", "trump", "ban", "supreme", "majority", "court", "religious", "statements", "president", "campaign", "look"], "summary": "Washington (CNN) The next stop in the legal challenge over the Trump administration's travel ban against people from six Muslim-majority countries may be the Supreme Court.\nBut while the majority said the travel ban \"drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination,\" the dissenters focused keenly on how the Supreme Court might view the case differently.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to \"seek review\" of the case at the Supreme Court.\nJudge Paul V.

The Justice Department has not yet filed its formal appellate brief in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case will eventually be heard, but that is the next step. The Fourth Circuit does not publicize ahead of time who will be on the eventual three-judge panel that hears the case. The lawsuit in Maryland was brought by refugee aid groups and foreign nationals who argued in court filings that the revised executive order \"was motivated by animus toward Muslims,\" and impermissibly discriminates on the basis of religion and national origin. In a 43-page decision, Chuang detailed many of Trump's statements about Muslims from the campaign trail and concluded that despite the significant changes to who was exempted by the executive order the second time around, \"the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the Second Executive Order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.\" ACLU attorney Omar Jadwat, who argued the Maryland case on behalf of the plaintiffs, said: \"We look forward to defending this careful and well-reasoned decision in the appeals court.\" Another federal judge in Hawaii issued a decision Wednesday resulting in a nationwide temporary restraining order of two key provisions of travel ban, just hours before the judge in Maryland. US District Court Judge Derrick Watson's ruling in Hawaii was slightly broader in scope in that it blocked both the 90-day ban on all foreign nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, as well as the 120-day ban on all refugees entering the country, while Chuang's ruling only concerns the 90-day ban. Additionally, Chuang issued a preliminary injunction, which will last through a trial on the merits of the case, while Watson only issued a temporary restraining order of the executive order, which is typically more limited in time. The Justice Department also filed a motion late Friday to clarify the scope of Watson's decision. The department claims in its filing that even though Watson's ruling suspends the 90- and 120-day bans, many of the provisions in the relevant sections of the executive order were not addressed in the briefs the plaintiffs filed in support of their request for a temporary restraining order. \"It is therefore unclear whether the court intended its injunction to extend to all of those provisions,\" the department said. The department goes on to request that if Watson meant for his decision to apply to the ban on refugees, the court should not apply the temporary restraining order to a cap of 50,000 refugees outlined in the executive order. \"Plaintiffs' briefing makes no mention of the cap, and this court did not address it in its order,\" the Justice Department says. \"Moreover, that cap -- which has global applicability -- draws no distinction whatsoever on the basis of religion, and none of the courts to analyze either the old or the new executive orders has called that cap into question.\" Hawaii and the other plaintiff in the case believe department's motion will \"unduly delay resolution\" of the case and have indicated that they will file an opposition brief, according to court filings.

A ruling by a federal judge in Hawaii Wednesday resulted in a temporary restraining order nationwide, hours before it was set to go into effect. In a decision published Thursday morning, another federal judge in Maryland specifically blocked the 90-day ban on immigration for citizens of six Muslim-majority countries. Both judges cited Trump's statements about Muslims during the presidential campaign as part of their rulings. Spicer indicated that the administration intends to appeal the Maryland decision to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals \"soon,\" and will seek \"clarification\" on the Hawaii ruling before heading to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In a 43-page ruling , US District Court Judge Derrick Watson, who presides in Honolulu, concluded in no uncertain terms that the new executive order failed to pass legal muster at this stage and the state had established \"a strong likelihood of success\" on their claims of religious discrimination. Trump decried Watson's ruling during a rally Wednesday night in Nashville, introducing his statement as \"the bad, the sad news.\" \"The order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first one,\" Trump said, as the crowd booed the news. \"This is, in the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach,\" he added, before pledging to take the issue to the Supreme Court if necessary. The practical effect of Watson's ruling -- which applies nationwide -- is that travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees will be able to travel to the US. Unlike the previous executive order, the new one removed Iraq from the list of banned countries, exempted those with green cards and visas and removed a provision that arguably prioritizes certain religious minorities. The new ban was announced earlier this month and was set to take effect Thursday. It would have banned people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. US District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu. | George Lee/The Star-Advertiser via AP \"The illogic of the Government's contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,\" Watson wrote. \"Equally flawed is the notion that the Executive Order cannot be found to have targeted Islam because it applies to all individuals in the six referenced countries,\" Watson added. \"It is undisputed, using the primary source upon which the Government itself relies, that these six countries have overwhelmingly Muslim populations that range from 90.7% to 99.8%.\" \"It would therefore be no paradigmatic leap to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets Islam,\" Watson added. \"Certainly, it would be inappropriate to conclude, as the Government does, that it does not.\" \"When considered alongside the constitutional injuries and harms ... and the questionable evidence supporting the Government's national security motivations, the balance of equities and public interests justify granting the Plaintiffs' (request to block the new order),\" Watson wrote. The Justice Department said it will defend the new travel ban. \"The Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the federal district court's ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and in scope. The President's Executive Order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our Nation's security, and the Department will continue to defend this Executive Order in the courts,\" DOJ said in a statement Wednesday night. Judge points to cable news comments After Trump initially blasted a federal judge in Seattle on Twitter for blocking the original travel ban, and several other federal courts halted its implementation last month, the White House went back to the drawing board for over a month and rewrote the ban -- hoping this one would survive legal scrutiny. Yet certain statements made by Trump's senior advisers have come back to bite the administration in court. Both Watson and Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland brought up specific statements made by the President and Stephen Miller, one of his top policy advisers and a reported architect of the original order, in cable news interviews. Trump made plain his opposition to Islam in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper last year, asserting: \"I think Islam hates us.\" Cooper asked then-candidate Trump in the interview to clarify if he meant Islam as a whole or just \"radical Islam,\" to which Trump replied, \"It's very hard to separate. Because you don't know who's who.\" The judge cited this interview as an example of the \"religious animus\" behind the executive order and quoted Trump telling Cooper: \"We can't allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States.\" Likewise, the decision cited an interview Miller had on Fox News following the legal struggles of the first executive order last month, which the legal opponents of the ban have emphasized repeatedly. In a February interview, Miller downplayed any major differences the new executive order would have from the first and said it would be \"responsive to the judicial ruling\" holding it up and have \"mostly minor technical differences.\" \"Fundamentally, you're still going to have the same basic policy outcome for the country,\" Miller added. \"These plainly-worded statements, made in the months leading up to and contemporaneous with the signing of the Executive Order, and, in many cases, made by the Executive himself, betray the Executive Order's stated secular purpose,\" Watson wrote. \"Any reasonable, objective observer would conclude, as does the court for purposes of the instant Motion for TRO, that the stated secular purpose of the Executive Order is, at the very least, 'secondary to a religious objective' of temporarily suspending the entry of Muslims,\" he added. Judge Theodore Chuang of Maryland. Chuang agreed. \"These statements, which include explicit, direct statements of President Trump's animus toward Muslims and intention to impose a ban on Muslims entering the United States, present a convincing case that the first executive order was issued to accomplish, as nearly as possible, President Trump's promised Muslim ban,\" Chuang wrote on Thursday. \"In particular, the direct statements by President Trump and (former New York City Mayor Rudy) Giuliani's account of his conversations with President Trump reveal that the plan had been to bar the entry of nationals of predominantly Muslim countries deemed to constitute dangerous territory in order to approximate a Muslim ban without calling it one precisely the form of the travel ban in the first executive order.\" Changes not enough, judge says While Watson signaled that this temporary freeze of the travel ban may not last forever, he nevertheless concluded that the changes made between the first and second versions of the travel ban weren't enough. \"Here, it is not the case that the Administration's past conduct must forever taint any effort by it to address the security concerns of the nation,\" he wrote. \"Based upon the current record available, however, the Court cannot find the actions taken during the interval between revoked Executive Order No. 13,769 and the new Executive Order to be 'genuine changes in constitutionally significant conditions.'\" Notably, however, Chuang issued a preliminary injunction, which will last through a trial on the merits of the case, whereas Watson only issued a temporary restraining order of the executive order, which is typically more limited in time. Watson said he intends to set an expedited hearing to determine whether it should be extended. Immigration advocates applauded Watson's ruling Wednesday evening immediately. \"The Constitution has once again put the brakes on President Trump's disgraceful and discriminatory ban.

Democrats' loss in the special election in a conservative Georgia district wasn't particularly devastating in and of itself, but the fact that they really went for it made it look like a massive failure, with nothing but doom and gloom ahead. With that in mind, I present the White House's gloating after the Supreme Court partially reinstated its travel ban on Monday. this one is delicious though. - Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) June 26, 2017 --- \"It's a huge win for the president and the executive order,\" Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said on Fox Business Network shortly after the ruling. Some conservative writers also hailed this as a win for Trump. David French of the (not exactly Trump-friendly) National Review wrote: \"Victory for Trump: SCOTUS Restores Vast Majority of Travel Ban.\" This is what you might call the soft bigotry of low expectations. Yes, the Supreme Court allowed for part of the White House's travel ban to go into effect after some judges had put the whole thing on hold. But if this is what passes for a big Trump win, it's going to be a long four years for him. For a few reasons: 1) This wouldn't really be seen as a \"win\" unless other judges hadn't halted the ban in the first place. If the lower courts had upheld the ban and this had been appealed to the Supreme Court by the other side, the narrative today would be that the Supreme Court just put part of Trump's travel ban on hold. It's also not altogether surprising that the more left-leaning 9th Circuit Court of Appeals would go further in halting the ban than the Supreme Court would. And the sum total is still that part of Trump's ban remains blocked, with no ruling on the overall constitutionality and the possibility that it gets partially struck down for good. 2) We are simply talking about whether Trump overstepped his constitutional bounds with the travel ban executive order - a very low bar - and not whether the broader policy is successful or popular. And in fact, a recent poll showed Americans oppose the ban 52-43. 3) The degree to which the ban is being reinstated is in the eye of the beholder. Basically, the court says the ban \"may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\" This is who actually sued over the ban in the first place, and they remain exempt from it, for now. 4) This is the revised, scaled-back version of Trump's initial travel ban, which was also halted by the courts. And just a few weeks ago, Trump didn't seem to be a big fan of Version 2.0, tweeting, \"The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.\" We are now to believe that a ban Trump suggested was inadequate and \"watered down\" is some big victory for his agenda? The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 --- 5) As The Post's Amber Phillips notes, the whole purpose of the ban is now in doubt. The White House initially pitched this as temporary travel ban needed to address an urgent national security concern while it developed more foolproof vetting procedures. It said it needed 90 days to do that (120 days for refugees); it's now been 150 days since the first attempt at a travel ban and 102 since the second (with no attacks by immigrants or refugees), but apparently the ban is still necessary? Even in their ruling, the judges seemed to allude to the idea that their input might be moot because that window had passed. Here's what the justices wrote: --- In addition to the issues identified in the petitions, the parties are directed to address the following question: \"Whether the challenges to \u00a72(c) became moot on June 14, 2017.\" --- Monday's ruling is a win for Trump only insofar as it wasn't another big setback - something he's become accustomed to both legislatively and in the courts. But this is a temporary ruling that is still blocking part of a signature executive order that Trump apparently isn't a huge fan of in the first place. Ted S.

The three judges on the panel -- all appointees of former President Bill Clinton -- peppered the parties with questions in an hour-long televised hearing Monday, appearing eager to flesh out exactly when the court might be allowed to look behind the plain text of the President's executive order find a discriminatory purpose. Two months ago, a federal judge in Hawaii halted the core portions of Trump's revised travel ban just hours before it was slated to go into effect nationwide, finding it likely violated the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. Trump immediately slammed the decision as \" an unprecedented judicial overreach \" and later tweeted about his frustrations with the West Coast-based 9th Circuit over an unrelated case. But on Monday, acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, urged the judges not to delve into a \"wide ranging inquiry into subjective motivation\" in considering Trump's past comments on Muslims, because \"the (executive) order on its face doesn't have anything to do with religion and in operation doesn't distinguish on the basis of religion.\" Neal Katyal, arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs, countered that they are not in favor of judicial \"psychoanalysis\" or trying to get in President's head, but suggested Trump's past statements evinced a \"repeated pattern\" that any neutral observer would find clear. \"Does that mean the President is forever barred from issuing an executive order along these lines?\" Judge Richard Paez asked. Katyal said no, suggested he wouldn't be arguing the case if it involved past campaign statements alone, pointed out that the President has never disavowed his past statements and noted a December 2015 press release calling for a \"complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering the country remained on Trump's campaign website up until early last week \"I think the most important point is if you don't say all these things, you never wind up with an executive order like this, which is why no president has done that,\" Katyal added. \"If you rule for him, you defer to the President in a way that history teaches us is very dangerous. You open the door to so much.\" The judges did not indicate when they will rule. In February, the court handed down a decision declining to reinstate the first travel ban just two days after oral arguments. Limits of presidential power This is the second time the 9th Circuit has been tasked with deciding the immediate fate of the President's travel ban. In February, a federal judge in Seattle halted the original travel ban nationwide, and a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit declined to reinstate it -- unanimously unpersuaded by the Trump administration's national security arguments and doubting travelers had been given adequate \"due process,\" such as \"notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual's ability to travel.\" But unlike the due process concerns driving the analysis in the last round, this time the different panel of judges appeared to wrestle with Trump's past statements about Muslims as it decides whether the lower court in Hawaii correctly blocked the revised ban. \"The executive order sets out national security justifications, but how is a court to know whether in fact it's a Muslim ban in the guise of national security justification?\" asked Judge Ronald Gould. Wall suggested that Supreme Court precedent should marshal against the judges \"second-guessing\" the President's \"national security determinations that they're sort of ill-equipped to do.\" But Paez seemed troubled by the logical conclusion of Wall's argument, asking him if the executive order at issue in the infamous case of Korematsu v. United States -- which ordered Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II -- would \"pass muster\" under Wall's theory today. \"No, Judge Paez,\" Wall immediately responded. \"I want to be very clear about this. This case is not Korematsu and if it were I wouldn't be standing here and the United States would not be defending it.\" \"I know (the plaintiffs) disagree with this president and many of his policy judgments but none of that converts this into a constitutional crisis,\" Wall added. \"And we respectfully submit that this court shouldn't treat it like one. It ought to leave this debate where it belong, its in the political arena.\" Travel ban headed to SCOTUS? The 9th Circuit isn't the only appeals court currently evaluating Trump's executive order. The Justice Department separately appealed a different federal judge's decision to halt the 90-day travel ban to the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The court heard arguments for two hours last week , but no word yet on when it might rule. In the event the two appellate courts reach different results, the travel ban will not go back into effect as long as one court's nationwide injunction remains in effect. But experts say such a scenario undoubtedly puts the case on track for review by the US Supreme Court. \"There's no guarantee that the 13 4th Circuit judges who heard argument last week will hand down their ruling before the three 9th Circuit judges hearing Monday's argument will,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. \"The real question, though, isn't the timing, but whether the two courts come out the same way. This issue may be bound for the Supreme Court no matter what, but it will certainly be heard by the justices if these lower courts disagree.\" \"No matter how the two courts rule, I predict this case will go to the Supreme Court,\" agreed Cornell Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr. \"The issue is too important for the Supreme Court to pass up.\"", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "judges", "trump", "ban", "circuit", "9th", "court", "presses", "trumps", "order", "president", "admin"], "summary": "Trump immediately slammed the decision as \" an unprecedented judicial overreach \" and later tweeted about his frustrations with the West Coast-based 9th Circuit over an unrelated case.\nIn February, the court handed down a decision declining to reinstate the first travel ban just two days after oral arguments.\nLimits of presidential powerThis is the second time the 9th Circuit has been tasked with deciding the immediate fate of the President's travel ban.\nThe 9th Circuit isn't the only appeals court currently evaluating Trump's executive order.\nThe Justice Department separately appealed a different federal judge's decision to halt the 90-day travel ban to the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals.", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-05-15", "authors": ["laura jarrett"], "id": "334", "author_string": "laura jarrett"}, {"title": "What's next in the travel ban lawsuits", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/30/politics/whats-next-in-the-travel-ban-lawsuits/index.html", "text": "(CNN) Hours after a federal appeals court issued a scathing rebuke of President Donald Trump's revised travel ban last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. Sessions was echoing his boss' tweet after the first travel ban was struck last February: \"SEE YOU IN COURT.\" Like the President, Sessions did not specify how or when the DOJ would appeal the decision. But the next steps the Trump administration takes will likely determine the future of a revised executive order that has never gone into effect. Here's what's happened and what's next: 4th Circuit upholds order blocking ban A majority of the federal appeals court based out of Richmond said last week that the travel ban likely violates the Constitution's Establishment Clause that \"stands as an untiring sentinel for the protection of one of our most founding principles -- that government shall not establish any religious orthodoxy, or favor or disfavor one religion over another.\" Without mincing words, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory said that the executive order is composed of \"vague words of national security\" but in context \"drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\" The judges upheld the block on the executive order pausing travel for 90 days from six majority-Muslim countries: Iran Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Regurgitating Trump's words on the campaign trail and as President, the majority concluded that the President had expressed \"anti-Muslim sentiment, as well as his intent, if elected, to ban Muslims from the United States.\" Concurring judges chimed in to say that the ban could be blocked for other reasons. Judge James A. Wynn Jr. said he believes the ban \"exceeds the President's authority under the Immigration Act.\" And Judge Stephanie D. Thacker, said she didn't even think the court needed to consider the President's remarks as candidate to reach its conclusion.

MUST WATCH Phil Mudd: Trump travel ban 'ass-backwards' 01:12 9th Circuit waiting to rule At any moment, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit is set to rule in a broader challenge that targets not only travel from the six countries but a separate refugee ban. The case is brought by the attorney general of Hawaii. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall argued in court that \"no one has ever attempted to set aside a law that is neutral on its face and neutral in operation on the basis of largely campaign trail comments made by a private citizen running for office,\" he said. Neal Katyal, the lead lawyer for Hawaii, argued in court papers that he is not only challenging the law on the Establishment Clause. \"The order also exceeds the President's statutory authority and contravenes the constitutional guarantee of Due Process,\" he wrote. Katyal could be thinking ahead to the Supreme Court. \"Because courts are reluctant to reach complicated constitutional questions if they don't have to, the justices could rule on statutory grounds and find that Congress hasn't granted the President the authority to issue an order of this kind,\" said Anil Kalhan of Drexel University Thomas R. Kline School of Law. At oral arguments the three judges on the 9th Circuit expressed interest in those statutory arguments. The panel's ruling could help determine if the Supreme Court takes up the case -- and questions it might consider. Supreme Court The dissenters in the 4th Circuit case made one thing clear: They do not think the Supreme Court will hold the President's campaign statements against the administration. \"Unless corrected by the Supreme Court, the majority's new approach, which is unsupported by any Supreme Court case, will become a sword for plaintiffs to challenging facially neutral government actions, particularly those affecting regions dominated by a single religion,\" Judge Paul V. Niemeyer wrote. And as he often is, Justice Anthony Kennedy will be key. Both sides are scrutinizing an opinion he wrote in 2015 regarding an immigration case in which a US citizen challenged the government's refusal to issue a visa for her spouse with little explanation. But just because the court currently consists of five conservative leaning judges and four liberals, it does not mean the case will break down along the usual ideological divide if it makes it to the high court. The travel ban touches not just on immigration, but involves issues such as the authority of the executive and the freedom of religion. But one thing is certain: it likely won't split 4-4 because Justice Neil Gorsuch -- President Trump's nominee -- is on the bench.

What seems unlikely is that the government will choose the slow route asking the Court to grant cert and hear the case next term. More likely the administration will file an emergency motion. Writing for the Take Care Blog, lawyer Joshua Matz, who has filed a brief in support of the challengers, points out that the revised travel ban is unique in one respect. It is time-limited. The key provision at issue, for example, directs that the entry into the US by nationals of six countries... be suspended for 90 days. \"This quirk in the order's shelf life,\" Matz writes, has \"significant implications.\" If the administration files an application and the justices grant the request, \"the Muslim Ban will go into effect, operate for the 90 days, and then expire on its own terms\" he said. But the order also allows for the 90-day timeline to be extended. Summertime? The court could also do something it hasn't done in a very long time: hold arguments over the summer. The justices rarely break into the summer recess, and they would have to be convinced that the administration had a genuine need for the issue to be resolved quickly. \"The justices have been reluctant in recent years to hold special sessions and they may be wary of causing a sensation by doing so here,\" wrote Matz.", "top_words": ["travel", "case", "lawsuits", "ban", "supreme", "circuit", "court", "sessions", "whats", "order", "president", "presidents"], "summary": "Sessions was echoing his boss' tweet after the first travel ban was struck last February: \"SEE YOU IN COURT.\"\nJUST WATCHED Phil Mudd: Trump travel ban 'ass-backwards' Replay More Videos ...

Now, after the courts have blocked the order and the President has issued a revised edition, the Department of Justice has gone to the Supreme Court. Has the President finally found a court that will endorse the legal underpinnings of the travel ban and allow it to go into effect? In legal briefs filed at 10:51 p.m. ET Thursday night, acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall asked the court for two things: allow the ban to go into effect now and hear arguments concerning its legality next fall. Many believe the justices will ultimately want to review the lower court opinions that struck down a major initiative of the Executive Branch. But would they allow the ban to go into effect immediately, before they even have the opportunity to hear arguments? As the court contemplates the government's requests -- and the country and much of the world waits -- legal experts are in overdrive exploring potential off ramps for the justices. As usual, Justice Anthony Kennedy could be the decider-in-chief. Complicating efforts could be the President's own words. Trump on Monday emphatically referred to his executive order on immigration as a \"travel ban\" and said his Justice Department should not have submitted a \"watered down, politically correct version\" to the Supreme Court. Trump's suggestion that changes to the ban were due to political correctness could hamper his administration's legal argument that the executive order did not target Muslims. As a candidate, Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslim immigration to the United States, and Justice Department lawyers have gone to great lengths to avoid calling it a \"travel ban\" in court, referring to it as a \"temporary pause\" or simply \"the executive order.\" Should the ban go into effect immediately? The first request the government makes -- asking for the court to put a hold on the lower courts' injunctions -- might be an uphill climb. One factor the justices will consider is whether \"irreparable harm\" would result from a denial of the government's request, keeping the lower courts' injunctions on the ban in place. Late Friday afternoon, the justices asked the challengers to respond to the government's petition. The challengers are likely to point out that since the revised travel ban was blocked before it could ever go into effect, there can't be any \"irreparable harm\" in maintaining the status quo. That might doom the government's application. JUST WATCHED Court upholds blocking of Trump's travel ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Court upholds blocking of Trump's travel ban 01:37 But what if the court did grant the government's request and allowed the ban to go into effect now? That could unleash an unusual circumstance because of the travel ban's unique time limitation. The ban suspends entry for 90 days for those seeking entry from six Muslim-majority countries. So, if the court allows it to go into effect immediately, by the time the justices hear the case next fall, the ban will have expired. \"At that point, the case may very well be moot,\" wrote Leah Litman, an assistant professor of law at University of California Irvine School of Law. Easy way out? Some believe the Supreme Court might be able to find a way to defuse the issue that is tangled up in two slightly different injunctions that have been issued by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and by a district court judge under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In essence, the justices would respond to the government's stay application by narrowing the scope of the injunctions, allowing some of the challenged provisions of the ban go into effect while upholding a block on the most contentious aspect: the section that actually suspends travel. Harvard Law School Professor Mark Tushnet floated the idea, calling it an \"easy out\" for the court. \"The case will then almost certainly be moot by the time it's argued, and all that would be left would be to clean things up, presumably by directing that whatever injunctions are still in effect should be vacated,\" he posited on the Balkinization blog, which discusses legal matters. The Kennedy factor But what if the court does not take Tushnet's off ramp and eventually digs into the merits of the case? Kennedy could, as usual, be a critical vote. Here's why: Challengers say the order is motivated by religious animus in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. The President's intent, they say, is evident from statements he made on the campaign trail referring to a so-called \"Muslim Ban.\" In its opinion that upheld a halt of the ban, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ringing endorsement of that argument.

Instead, he argues, they need to look only at the face of the order. In doing so, they will find the order is neutral with respect to religion and is necessary to support national security determinations. \"It is religion-neutral in operation,\" Wall wrote. \"It draws distinctions among countries based on national-security risks identified by Congress and the Executive (Branch), not religion.\" That's where Kennedy could come in play.

In its opinion, the majority of the Fourth Circuit said: \"Kennedy explained that where a plaintiff makes 'an affirmative showing of bad faith' ... courts may 'look behind' the challenged action.\" In his legal filings, Wall said the Court of Appeals got it wrong and rested on a \"misreading of a statement in Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Din.\" Wall said, in essence, that Kennedy was not endorsing a \"wide-ranging search for pretext.\" End of the term The court is likely to act on the government's requests sometime in June during the final month of the current term.

Despite the fact that Trump has resoundingly and repeatedly criticized the 9th Circuit , five judges came to the President's defense, saying that \"whatever we, as individuals, may feel about the President or the Executive Order, the President's decision was well within the powers of the presidency.\" The comments from the five judges do not impact the move by a federal judge in Hawaii who blocked Trump's new travel ban on Wednesday. But it could be meaningful down the line. If the Justice Department appeals the Hawaii ruling, the case will be headed to the 9th Circuit and could very well be heard by these same five judges who now say the law is on Trump's side. An unusual move Last week, the day after Trump signed the new travel ban, the Justice Department voluntarily moved to dismiss its appeal of an earlier federal ruling that blocked implementation of the original travel ban nationwide -- meaning the case was out of the hands of the 9th Circuit. But that didn't stop members of the court from weighing in on their three colleagues' earlier -- but now moot -- declination to reinstate the original travel ban last month. \"The panel's errors are many and obvious\" and the decision \"stands contrary to well-established separation-of-powers principles,\" wrote Judge Jay Bybee, who was joined by four other Republican-nominated judges in a blistering 26-page missive. \"We are all acutely aware of the enormous controversy and chaos that attended the issuance of the Executive Order,\" but \"we cannot let our personal inclinations get ahead of important, overarching principles about who gets to make decisions in our democracy.\" Condemning Trump attacks on judiciary The judges did, however, issue a strong condemnation of Trump's \"personal attacks\" on US District Court Judge James Robart in Seattle, who originally froze the travel ban. \"The personal attacks on the distinguished district judge and our colleagues were out of all bounds of civic and persuasive discourse -- particularly when they came from the parties,\" they wrote. \"Such personal attacks treat the court as though it were merely a political forum in which bargaining, compromise, and even intimidation are acceptable principles,\" the judges added. \"The courts of law must be more than that, or we are not governed by law at all.\"", "top_words": ["principles", "travel", "judges", "trump", "ban", "judge", "support", "court", "trumps", "personal", "signal", "republicannominated", "attacks"], "summary": "(CNN) Five Republican-appointed judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals signaled their support for the legal underpinnings of President Donald Trump's travel ban late Wednesday in an unusual and unsolicited filing .\nThe comments from the five judges do not impact the move by a federal judge in Hawaii who blocked Trump's new travel ban on Wednesday.\nAn unusual moveLast week, the day after Trump signed the new travel ban, the Justice Department voluntarily moved to dismiss its appeal of an earlier federal ruling that blocked implementation of the original travel ban nationwide -- meaning the case was out of the hands of the 9th Circuit.\nBut that didn't stop members of the court from weighing in on their three colleagues' earlier -- but now moot -- declination to reinstate the original travel ban last month.\nCondemning Trump attacks on judiciaryThe judges did, however, issue a strong condemnation of Trump's \"personal attacks\" on US District Court Judge James Robart in Seattle, who originally froze the travel ban.", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "authors": ["laura jarrett"], "id": "309", "author_string": "laura jarrett"}, {"title": "5 things to watch for in a new travel ban", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/20/politics/five-questions-new-travel-ban/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) The Trump administration is taking another crack at rewriting its embattled travel ban this week, hoping this one will stand up in court. Multiple federal courts across the country have granted requests to temporarily halt enforcement of the President's executive order barring foreign nationals from Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and all refugees from Syria indefinitely. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said over the weekend that the White House is working on a \"tighter, more streamlined version of the first executive order.\" But how exactly the administration plans to thread the needle between its travel ban and complying with the rights enshrined in the Constitution remains to be seen. Here are the five main questions that could determine whether the new order will withstand legal challenges: 1. What's the length of phase-in period? The tumultuous rollout of Trump's travel ban last month -- chaos at airports, lack of guidance to front-line employees, no congressional understanding of the executive order -- did not go unnoticed by the federal judiciary. As US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema remarked at a hearing in Virginia earlier this month: \"It's quite clear that ... not all the thought went into it that should have gone into it. As a result, there has been chaos.\" The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals further explained that the Justice Department failed to show that the executive order \"provides what due process requires, such as notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual's ability to travel.\" Kelly said this time around, the Department of Homeland Security would ensure that \"there's no one, in a sense, caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports, which happened on the first release,\" and \"short phase-in period to make sure that people on the other end don't get on airplanes.\" But how \"short\" is too short for the process that is due under the Constitution? 2. Is there any new evidence on those seven Muslim-majority countries? The original executive order suspended citizens from Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days and barred refugees from Syria indefinitely. But the 9th Circuit noted that the Trump administration \"pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\" \"The defendants have responded with no evidence other than the (executive order),\" Brinkema similarly noted in her opinion last week. Will the Justice Department attempt to bolster the record about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations this time around? 3. Is there any preference for religious minorities? Section 5(b) of the current executive order arguably prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities. The states that have challenged the travel ban say this provision -- among others -- violates the Constitution because it is mere pretext for religious discrimination against Muslims, pointing to Trump's rhetoric of a \"Muslim ban\" from the campaign trail. Courts have noted that the Trump administration hasn't denied these statements and evidence of a discriminatory purpose \"beyond the face\" of an executive action may be examined -- so if the new executive order strikes all or part of section 5, does that help the administration's case? 4. What happens to student visa-holders? Kelly said it's a \"good assumption\" to believe legal permanent residents or green card holders will be formally exempted from the executive order. But the current lawsuits involve many more diverse categories of foreign travelers. For instance, the Virginia attorney general's office successfully argued that the travel ban was hurting student enrollment and faculty recruitment at its public universities. So if visa holders are not protected like green card holders -- how does the government avoid more litigation? 5. Will existing visas be revoked again? The 9th Circuit noted that even if legal permanent residents were protected under the executive order, \"the States would continue to have potential claims regarding possible due process rights of ... non-immigrant visa holders who have been in the United States but temporarily departed or wish to temporarily depart,\" and those \"who have a relationship with a US resident or an institution that might have rights of its own to assert.\" Last month, the State Department revealed that 60,000 visas were revoked after Trump signed the executive order. The agency was then forced to reverse the cancellation of those visas after a federal judge in Seattle blocked applicable sections of the executive order. So what happens this time to the visa-holder from Iran with relatives in the US?", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "trump", "ban", "watch", "holders", "evidence", "syria", "things", "order", "noted", "department"], "summary": "Washington (CNN) The Trump administration is taking another crack at rewriting its embattled travel ban this week, hoping this one will stand up in court.\nBut how exactly the administration plans to thread the needle between its travel ban and complying with the rights enshrined in the Constitution remains to be seen.\nThe tumultuous rollout of Trump's travel ban last month -- chaos at airports, lack of guidance to front-line employees, no congressional understanding of the executive order -- did not go unnoticed by the federal judiciary.\nThe states that have challenged the travel ban say this provision -- among others -- violates the Constitution because it is mere pretext for religious discrimination against Muslims, pointing to Trump's rhetoric of a \"Muslim ban\" from the campaign trail.\nFor instance, the Virginia attorney general's office successfully argued that the travel ban was hurting student enrollment and faculty recruitment at its public universities.", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-02-20", "authors": ["laura jarrett"], "id": "268", "author_string": "laura jarrett"}, {"title": "How opponents may challenge Trump's order in court", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/trump-travel-ban-legal/index.html", "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's executive order banning more than 218 million people from the United States was met with swift legal challenges over the weekend across the country. Judges from New York to Seattle have granted limited relief for citizens of the seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US (or are in the air) with a valid visa or green card, blocking their deportation from the country (for now). Advocacy groups say they plan to file additional lawsuits in the days to come challenging the constitutionality of the order as whole. Here are several key legal issues: Presidential power on immigration is sweeping, but prohibits discrimination Trump's order relies on the broad executive powers outlined in Immigration and Nationality Act (or INA), which provides: \"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\" Another section of the law, however, states that \"no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\" Non-discrimination clause Experts have pointed to a variety of legal avenues foreign nationals potentially have at their disposal to challenge the order. Some say the most direct approach would be an attack based on the non-discrimination clause of the INA. David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote that \"Trump's new policy would run afoul of at least one if not all three of (the) restrictions -- nationality, place of birth, or place of residence -- depending on how it was applied.\" While the Act extends to green card holders, legal experts say refugees outside of the US may continue to be lawfully excluded before they enter because they lack a guaranteed right to come into the US under current law. Yet once on American soil, US and international law prohibits the deportation of non-citizens who can establish that they will face torture or persecution if returned home. Due process Other experts highlight the constitutional questions in play, especially for those who are currently detained at airports around the country. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, likened it to the state revoking or suspending a driver's license without affording the driver an opportunity to be heard. \"That's a procedural due process violation,\" Yale-Loehr explained. \"They can't just put you on a plane and send you back without any sort of hearing at all -- courts look at the interest of the individual, the interest of the government, and balance the two.\" Religious test? And while the executive order does not explicitly ban all Muslims from entering the country, constitutional lawyers say Trump could have an equal protection problem on his hands if a court were to find that he is intentionally discriminating on the basis of national origin -- the argument would be that he has no rational basis to treat a foreign national from Germany or France differently than someone from Iran or Iraq. David Cole, national legal director of the ACLU and Georgetown University law professor, and others have argued that by showing \"preferential treatment\" for Christian refugees seeking asylum over Muslims or by seeking to \"disfavor a particular religion,\" the executive order would violate the Establishment Clause. \"The executive order, of course, does not say in express terms that it is favoring Christians and disfavoring Muslims. But Trump is the signatory, and he has said so explicitly,\" wrote Cole. Speaking with the Christian Broadcasting Network last week , Trump said that it had been \"impossible, or at least very tough\" for Syrian Christians to enter the United States. \"If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair -- everybody was persecuted, in all fairness -- but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\" Now what? Trump insisted Saturday that the travel ban did not amount to \"a Muslim ban\" like the one he called for in during the primary campaign, and his administration showed no signs Sunday of backing down from enforcing the order. \"It is the right and duty of the President to do everything in his legal and Constitutional power to protect the American people. Saturday's ruling does not undercut the President's executive order. All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited. The executive order is a vital action toward strengthening America's borders, and therefore sovereignty. The order remains in place,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement. Whether the order will hold up in court is an open question. \"(P)residents have wide discretion on immigration, because immigration touches national sovereignty and foreign relations. Courts tend to defer to whatever a president declares on immigration. I think the administration could win,\" said Yale-Loehr. \"The national security interests (likely asserted here) may make it particularly hard to win in court even though the order seems so egregiously unconstitutional.\" CNN's Ariane de Vogue and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.", "top_words": ["executive", "aliens", "national", "challenge", "immigration", "place", "court", "united", "say", "trumps", "opponents", "order", "law", "legal"], "summary": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's executive order banning more than 218 million people from the United States was met with swift legal challenges over the weekend across the country.\nNon-discrimination clauseExperts have pointed to a variety of legal avenues foreign nationals potentially have at their disposal to challenge the order.\n\"The executive order, of course, does not say in express terms that it is favoring Christians and disfavoring Muslims.\nSaturday's ruling does not undercut the President's executive order.\nThe executive order is a vital action toward strengthening America's borders, and therefore sovereignty.", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-01-29", "authors": ["laura jarrett"], "id": "156", "author_string": "laura jarrett"}, {"title": "Trump's latest tweets could hurt effort to restore travel ban", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-travel-ban-20170605-story.html", "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday derided the revised travel ban as a \"watered down\" version of the first and criticized his own Justice Department's handling of the case - potentially hurting the administration's defense of the ban as the legal battle over it reaches a critical new stage. Trump in a tweet called the new ban \"politically correct,\" ignoring the fact that he himself signed the executive order replacing the first ban with a revised version that targeted six, rather than seven, Muslim-majority countries and that blocked the issuance of new visas rather than revoking current ones. Trump said the Justice Department should seek a \"much tougher version\" and made clear - despite his press secretary's past remarks to the contrary - that the executive order is a \"ban,\" not a pause on some sources of immigration or an enhanced vetting system. \"People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\" Trump wrote. The president's tweets could significantly damage his administration's effort to restore the ban, which has been put on hold by two federal courts. Next week, those suing are expected to file arguments on the matter with the Supreme Court, and Trump's latest remarks will surely be part of their briefs. The administration appealed to the nation's highest court after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the freeze on the ban last month. Neal Katyal, the lawyer who argued for the challengers in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, wrote on Twitter, \"Its kinda odd to have the defendant in HawaiivTrump acting as our co-counsel. We don't need the help but will take it!\" He also wrote that he was \"waiting now for the inevitable cover-my-tweet posts from him that the Solicitor General will no doubt insist upon.\" Even George Conway, a prominent lawyer who recently took himself out of the running to lead the Justice Department's Civil Division and who is the husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, posted on Twitter that the remarks might hurt the legal case. \"These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won't help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad,\" he wrote, using abbreviations for Office of Solicitor General and the Supreme Court. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was \"not at all\" concerned that his tweets might muddy the legal case, and his attention was instead on the substance of his executive order. She said she was not aware of any vetting of his tweets by lawyers or aides. \"The president is very focused on exactly what that order spells out, and that's protecting Americans, protecting national security, and he has every constitutional authority to do that through that executive order and he maintains that, and that position hasn't changed in the slightest,\" Sanders said. Trump himself indicated late in the day that he had no intention of backing down from his early morning sentiments, tweeting, \"That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!\" Federal judges across the country have focused acutely on Trump's own comments in ordering that the ban be frozen, determining that the president's words expose the measure as being a tool for discrimination disguised as a national security directive. The majority opinion in the 4th Circuit maintaining the freeze on the ban quoted extensively from Trump's tweets and media interviews, and from those of his advisers. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" Omar Jadwat, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case in the 4th Circuit, wrote that Trump's tweets amounted to \"a promise: let me do this and I'll take it as license to do even worse.\" In an interview, Jadwat said the president's tweets \"seem to undermine the picture the government's been trying to paint.\" \"I can't say for sure what our brief is going to look like, but this stuff seems relevant,\" Jadwat said. Government lawyers have sought to convince judges that they should not consider the president's statements but instead limit their analysis to the text of the ban. They have also sought to portray the president's words as campaign trail rhetoric, and noted that many of the remarks in question - though not all - came before Trump was elected. \"We shouldn't start down the road of psychoanalyzing what people meant on the campaign trail,\" acting solicitor general Jeffrey Wall told judges at a recent court hearing in the 9th Circuit. Trump's latest tweets - which were later set to dramatic music and posted in a video on his Facebook page - will provide those challenging the ban more examples of post-election remarks and a stronger case that Trump's revised travel ban had the same purpose as the original version. That version, which unilaterally revoked the visas of tens of thousands of people from seven Muslim-majority countries, was seen as much harder to defend because it was more onerous and had a provision in the text that seemed designed to exempt Christian travelers. Trump tweeted Monday that the Justice Department \"should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted\" to the Supreme Court. In addition to creating possible headaches in court, that misstates the process. Trump signed the executive order imposing the ban. The Justice Department defends his policies in court. Trump also wrote that the Justice Department \"should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!\" The Supreme Court would not be the body to enact a ban; the justices will be weighing whether Trump's order is constitutional. The travel ban seems to have been on Trump's mind since the terrorist attack in London on Saturday, when Trump wrote on Twitter, \"We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\" Legal analysts were quick to point out that the president was hurting his own case. \"In case it's not obvious, these will only undermine the government's case before #SCOTUS for both a stay & on the merits of the #TravelBan,\" University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck posted on Twitter. \"These will also go a long way toward mooting debate over use of campaign statements; no need when, as President, he still says these things.\"", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-06-05", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 377, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Legal challenges to Trump's revised travel ban mount in additional states", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-travel-ban-lawsuits-20170309-story.html", "text": "Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who sued successfully to block President Donald Trump's first entry ban, asked a federal judge Thursday to affirm that the suspension of the initial ban applies to the new one. Ferguson said Trump's new executive order imposes many of the same economic and other harms as the first one in late January, even though it is different in important ways. And he said a federal judge, rather than the administration, should decide whether the original freeze should remain in place. \"The court decides that,\" Ferguson said, \"not the president.\" Ferguson, a Democrat, made his request to U.S. District Judge James Robart, the federal judge in Washington state who first suspended Trump's ban nationwide. After Robart imposed that freeze, Trump lashed out on Twitter and targeted Robart personally. \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" Trump wrote. The state of Hawaii already has asked a federal judge there to block Trump's new executive order, which bars the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the refugee program for 120 days. A hearing in that case is set for March 15. Robart could presumably act before that, and it is possible that other legal challenges will emerge. Ferguson - who sued initially with the state of Minnesota - is expected to be joined by other states, including New York, Oregon and Massachusetts. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman dropped out of a case in that state Thursday to be a part of the effort in Washington. \"President Trump's latest executive order is a Muslim Ban by another name, imposing policies and protocols that once again violate the Equal Protection Clause and Establishment Clause of the United State Constitution,\" Schneiderman said in a statement. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. The first ban affected seven countries and the refugee program, and the administration implemented it by revoking tens of thousands of visas and detaining people as they landed at U.S. airports. The new ban specifically exempts current visa holders and spells out a robust list of people who could be granted waivers as they apply for new visas. Justice Department lawyers have said that the administration plans to enforce the measure on March 16, unless a court tells them otherwise. Pursuing the case in Washington state might have strategic advantages, as both Robart and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit - which is where the case could head after his decision - have previously ruled against the administration on the travel ban. Hawaii is also in the 9th Circuit. The Justice Department has asserted the new order differs from the old \"in critical respects,\" although before it was inked, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News that it would have \"mostly minor technical differences\" from the iteration frozen by the courts and that Americans would see \"the same basic policy outcome for the country.\" Ferguson said previously that the administration \"capitulated on numerous key provisions that we contested in court.\" Washington state's lawyers said they would continue to try to use as evidence comments by the president and his top advisers endorsing the idea of a Muslim ban, which they will argue violates the Constitution. They said they believe the burden is on the government to convince a judge that the freeze should not be in effect, rather than the other way around.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-03-09", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 392, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "New travel ban will exempt current visa holders", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-travel-ban-visa-holders-20170228-story.html", "text": "Barring any last-minute changes, President Donald Trump will sign a revised travel ban that exempts current visa holders, according to people familiar with the matter. The revision marks a significant departure from the now-frozen first executive order, which temporarily barred citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and all refugees from entering the United States, and resulted in the State Department revoking tens of thousands of visas. Justice Department lawyers hope the new order will be more likely to withstand legal challenges and will not leave any travelers detained at U.S. airports. The new order also removes an exception to the refugee prohibition for religious minorities, one person said. Critics of the order had said that that exception proved the order was meant to discriminate on the basis of religion, because it allowed only Christians into the country. The new order, the details of which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is expected to be signed Wednesday. The people who described it to The Post did so on the condition of anonymity because the administration had not authorized the release of details. The people said that the situation is fluid and that changes are still possible. There will be a period between when the order is signed and when it takes effect, in hopes of avoiding the problems that occurred when the last order was implemented. While blocking only the issuance of new visas marks a substantial change, analysts have said that this would not necessarily be enough for the order to pass legal muster. Spokesmen for the White House, Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security declined to comment for this story. A federal district judge in Washington state first suspended the travel ban Feb. 3, and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit later upheld that freeze. The Justice Department has since asked the courts to hold off on further litigation while a new executive order was crafted, although the Court of Appeals told the parties to press ahead with the case. While that has been ongoing, refugees as well as people from the seven-affected countries have been able to enter the United States subject to normal individual screenings on arrival. The president has broad authority to set immigration policy, although Trump's first executive order was implemented in such a way that most judges agreed that the directive - or at least aspects of it - should be suspended. Judges have yet to weigh whether the ban is constitutional. Trump and his top spokesmen have asserted that they feel they are on strong legal footing, despite short-term losses. The White House counsel already had clarified that the ban did not apply to legal permanent residents, although courts have said they could not rely on that assertion because it was a separate statement and not part of the executive order. Officials hope the new executive order will allay that concern and also reduce the number of plaintiffs who have the right to sue. Even that, though, might not go far enough. The 9th Circuit panel that ruled the ban should remain frozen said such a revision would not address claims \"by citizens who have an interest in specific noncitizens' ability to travel to the United States.\" That, analysts have said, might be referring to the foreign wife of a U.S. citizen who is seeking a visa. A spokesman for Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had successfully sued to freeze the ban, said, \"Our current stance is to wait and see the particulars, which could make all the difference.\" Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's national Immigrants' Rights Project, who is involved in a separate legal challenge, said: \"If the new executive order contains a ban, we believe it is unconstitutional religious discrimination and will therefore continue our legal challenges.\" The administration must also contend with comments the president and top allies and his advisers have made, which could serve as evidence that the ban was intended to discriminate on religious grounds. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" And after the election, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani said: \"So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.'\" A federal judge in Virginia referenced those comments in ordering the ban frozen with respect to Virginia residents and institutions, calling it \"unrebutted evidence\" that Trump's directive might violate the First Amendment. That is important, because if judges found that even the new order was designed to discriminate against Muslims - and not to protect national security - they might similarly strike it down. Justice Department lawyers will have to try to convince judges that there is a national security reason for the ban and that it is not a tool for discrimination. That the new order will not include an exception for religious minorities - which had been seen as a way to get only Christians into the country - is likely to bolster the government's case, particularly if Justice Department lawyers convince the judiciary to look mostly at the executive order itself for evidence of the administration's purpose. But analysts said the new order cannot wash away completely the stains of the old one - especially after senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said that the revised version would have \"mostly minor technical differences\" and that Americans would see \"the same basic policy outcome for the country.\" And the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis recently produced a report casting doubt on the need for the executive order, concluding that citizenship of a particular country is an \"unreliable\" threat indicator and that people from the seven countries named in the original ban have rarely been implicated in U.S.-based terrorism.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 401, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Federal judge declines to immediately apply freeze of first Trump travel ban to new order", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-travel-ban-lawsuit-20170310-story.html", "text": "A federal judge in Washington state on Friday declined to declare immediately that his freeze of President Donald Trump's original travel ban applied to the new executive order, saying he could not do so until the state filed an amended complaint challenging the new directive head on. The decision from U.S. District Judge James Robart is a modest blow to the state of Washington, which had sued over the ban, because the quickest path to success would have been getting the judge to declare that Trump's new order was affected by the freeze he imposed previously. But Robart declined to do that only for procedural reasons and did not address the merits of any arguments. Neither side, he wrote, had filed a motion for him to consider, and the state's previous complaints were directed at an executive order which is now revoked. \"Accordingly, the court also declines to resolve the apparent dispute between the parties concerning the applicability of the court's injunctive order to the New Executive Order until such time as an amended complaint that addresses the New Executive Order is properly before the court,\" Robart wrote. The Washington attorney general's office wrote on Twitter that its legal team was reviewing the order to \"determine next steps.\" The state had already indicated it would file an amended complaint, but it is unclear how soon the judge could take that up. Trump's new order, which is set to take effect on March 16, temporarily blocks the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries, and it suspends the U.S. refugee program. Like the first order -- which suspended the refugee program, blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the country, and resulted in the provisional revocation of tens of thousands of visas -- it has encountered significant legal resistance. Hawaii was the first state to sue over the new order, and a hearing in that case is scheduled for Wednesday. A federal judge in Maryland will also hear arguments on that day in a separate suit over the ban.

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson scheduled a hearing for March 15 at 3:30 p.m. Eastern time to hear arguments on the state of Hawaii's latest legal challenge to the order. Hawaii late Wednesday formally filed its lawsuit asking Watson to block the executive order. The 38-page complaint asserts that the new executive order - much like the old - violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment because it is essentially a Muslim ban, hurts the ability of state businesses and universities to recruit top talent and damages the financial interests of the state, which considers tourism its lead economic driver. \"President Trump's new Executive Order is antithetical to Hawaii's State identity and spirit,\" lawyers for the state wrote. \"For many in Hawaii, including State officials, the Executive Order conjures up the memory of the Chinese Exclusion Acts and the imposition of martial law and Japanese internment after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.\" Trump's new travel ban is substantially revised from its original version, and those who sue over it will probably have a harder time getting it immediately frozen by the courts. They will have to convince judges that there is an urgent need to do so and that, in the long term, Trump will probably be found to have run afoul of the First Amendment. The new order reduces the list of affected countries from seven to six - removing Iraq while keeping Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria. It explicitly exempts legal permanent residents and current visa holders, blocking only the issuance of new visas for citizens of the affected countries for 90 days. It also spells out a lengthy list of people who may be eligible for exceptions, including those previously admitted to the United States for \"a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity\"; those with \"significant business or professional obligations\"; and those seeking to visit or live with family. The new order keeps intact a 120-day suspension of the refugee program, and it declares that the United States will not accept more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal 2017, down from the 110,000 cap set by the Obama administration. It will take effect March 16 unless a court intervenes before then. In its lawsuit, Hawaii argues that foreign residents and travelers contribute substantially to the functioning of the state, and blocking even the issuance of new visas would have a major impact. State lawyers wrote that Hawaii is home to 12,000 foreign students, and at least 27 graduate students are from the seven countries affected by the original ban. In 2016, lawyers for the state wrote, Hawaii's foreign students contributed more than $400 million to Hawaii's economy with tuition and fees, living expenses and other activities. The lawyers also said that tourism was a driver of Hawaii's economy, and that 8.7 million visitors accounted for $15 billion in spending in 2015. As others did with the first travel ban, Hawaii is still pointing to campaign trail comments by Trump indicating that he wanted to impose a blanket ban on Muslims as evidence that the order violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. U.S. officials have disputed that characterization. Justice Department lawyers have asserted that a short-term freeze is especially unnecessary, because the new ban only applies to the issuance of new visas, a process that can take months. In its court filing, the state pointed to the case of Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii, whose mother-in-law's application for an immigrant visa was still being processed. Under the new executive order, lawyers for Hawaii said, Elshikh feared that his mother-in-law would ultimately be banned from entering the United States. That could be true, and Elshikh, a U.S. citizen, would have better standing to sue in U.S. courts than a noncitizen. But Justice Department lawyers might point to the waiver process as a way the imam's mother-in-law could enter the country. The state of Washington had successfully convinced a U.S. district judge and a three-judge appellate panel that economic harms imposed by Trump's first ban presented a need to immediately order the measure suspended. The new order, though, might lessen the effect of any harms.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-03-08", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 345, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Federal judge to hear first lawsuit against new travel ban", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/politics/hawaii-travel-ban-lawsuit/index.html", "text": "(CNN) A federal judge in Hawaii has agreed to hear the first legal challenge to President Donald Trump's new travel ban on March 15 -- just hours before it is slated to go into effect. Attorneys for the state filed a new 40-page request just before midnight on Tuesday, asking a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order blocking implementation of the new executive order. Trump signed a new executive order Monday banning foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and banning all refugees for 120 days. In a statement, Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin said the filings ask the court to declare sections 2 and 6 of Trump's executive order contrary to the constitution and federal law. \"Sections 2 and 6 of the March 6, 2017 Executive Order violate the Immigration and Nationality Act by discriminating on the basis of nationality, ignoring and modifying the statutory criteria for determining terrorism-related inadmissibility, and exceeding the President's authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\" Chin said in a statement. \"The new executive order is resulting in the establishment of religion in the state of Hawaii contrary to its state constitution; it is inflicting immediate damage to Hawaii's economy, educational institutions, and tourism industry; and it is subjecting a portion of the state's citizens to second-class treatment and discrimination, while denying all Hawaii residents the benefits of an inclusive and pluralistic society,\" attorneys for the state argued in court filings. \"The executive order means that thousands of individuals across the United States and in Hawaii who have immediate family members living in the affected countries will now be unable to receive visits from those persons or to be reunited with them in the United States.\" The Justice Department declined to comment on the filing, but will have an opportunity to respond to the state's amended complaint against the travel ban on March 13. \"The entire history and culture of Hawaii is based upon nondiscrimination either in its constitution as well as its laws,\" Chin told CNN affiliate KHON. \"Hawaii has 20% foreign-born residents and 100,000 people who are not citizens as well as 20% of our workforce that are not foreign born.\" US District Court Judge Derrick Watson approved the expedited briefing schedule the parties proposed in order for the case to be heard before the new executive order goes into effect on March 16. Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued Monday that the ban was necessary because \"we cannot compromise our nation's security by allowing visitors entry when their own governments are unable or unwilling to provide the information we need to vet them responsibly, or when those governments actively support terrorism.\" Hawaii had previously sued over Trump's original travel ban, but the case was put on hold temporarily while a different federal judge's nationwide temporary restraining order halting the original ban remained in place. Watson granted the state's request to lift that hold on Wednesday in light of the new executive order. \"To be sure, the new executive order covers fewer people than the old one,\" Neal Katyal, one of the lead attorneys for Hawaii and former acting US solicitor general, explained in an interview with CNN. But in his view, the new travel ban still \"suffers from the same constitutional and statutory defects.\" JUST WATCHED US travel ban leaves LGBT refugees in limbo Replay More Videos ...

Trump signed a new executive order last week banning foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and banning all refugees for 120 days. The new order excludes those with green cards and valid visas. But the states that sued Trump over the original executive order have popped back to the surface with gusto, saying that merely changing who is exempted under the order doesn't make it constitutional and the new ban \"differs only cosmetically.\" On Monday,Washington and Minnesota -- two of the states that successfully blocked the original travel ban -- asked a federal judge to enforce his earlier ruling against the new travel ban as well. Other states have hearings scheduled for Wednesday -- just one day before the new travel ban is scheduled to go into effect. Here are the cases to watch before the new executive order goes into effect on Thursday: State challenges One day after Trump signed the new executive order, Hawaii mounted the first legal challenge last Tuesday. Attorneys for the state argue that new executive order remains discriminatory and harms the economy, and have asked a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order blocking several provisions of the new order. The Justice Department filed a 54-page response to that new challenge on Monday, arguing the new travel ban: (1) only applies to foreign nationals with no constitutional right to enter the US; (2) affords \"more than ample process\" for someone seeking admission through the waiver system; and (3) does not discriminate on the basis of religion, as \"it no longer grants any preference for victims of religious persecution.\" DOJ's filing also included a newly released letter from the heads of Homeland Security and DOJ supporting the travel ban. \"There are currently approximately I,000 pending domestic terrorism-related investigations, and it is believed that a majority of those subjects are inspired, at least in part, by ISIS,\" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Attorney General Jeff Sessions jointly wrote in the letter. \"We expend enormous manpower and resources investigating terrorism-related activities of foreign nationals admitted to the United States. ... Furthermore, based on DHS data and the experience of its operators, nationals from these countries are more likely to overstay their visas and are harder to remove to their home countries.\" The judge will hear oral arguments from both sides in Honolulu on Wednesday. JUST WATCHED Trump signs updated travel ban, takes effect March 16 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump signs updated travel ban, takes effect March 16 04:15 Washington and Minnesota followed in Hawaii's footsteps last week, announcing that they, too, planned ask a federal judge in Seattle to halt the new travel ban. Attorneys in that case argue that the new executive order \"purports to reinstate two provisions of the prior order\" that US District Court James Robart blocked last month, and therefore, the new order must remain suspended as well. \"While the second executive order now excludes Iraqis, lawful permanent residents, and visa-holders from its travel ban, it bars entry for virtually all other individuals from the listed countries, including: relatives of US citizens; students who have been admitted to state universities but not yet received visas; prospective employees of state universities or private businesses who have been offered positions but not yet obtained visas; and students and employees who may need to renew their visas,\" attorneys argued in a court filing Monday. \"All of these individuals (and the institutions that wish to admit or hire them) are protected by this Court's injunction, but are nonetheless targeted and harmed by the second executive order.\" Attorneys general from Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and California confirmed they are also planning to join the lawsuit in Seattle. The Justice Department declined to comment to CNN on the status of any ongoing litigation. But it filed a \"notice\" with Robart after the order was signed last week, claiming that the administration believes the new executive order \"falls outside of the scope\" of Robart's earlier ruling. The administration cited the substantial changes to the executive order, arguing that it \"clarifies and narrows the scope of executive action regarding immigration, extinguishes the need for emergent consideration, and eliminates the potential constitutional concerns identified by the Ninth Circuit.\" But late last week, Robart told everyone: not so fast. He explained that the parties hadn't technically asked him to rule on any new request yet, and therefore, declined to resolve any of the outstanding issues until one side filed a procedurally proper motion under local and federal rules. As a result, on Monday morning, the Washington state attorney general's office filed a proposed amended complaint along with a formal motion to enforce Robart's original preliminary injunction suspending the travel ban. But Robart rejected the states' request for an expedited hearing on the matter on Tuesday, and instead ordered the Justice Department to file a response Tuesday. Additionally, the states filed nearly 50 new \"declarations\" from residents, educational institutions, businesses and religious organizations, which set forth many of the harms they claim to face under the new executive order. Individual challenges At least one of the individual challengers of the new executive order had success last Friday. A Syrian \"John Doe\" plaintiff living in Wisconsin successfully argued that the new travel ban is preventing him from reuniting with his wife and child who are currently trapped in Aleppo. A federal judge in Madison acknowledged some \"important differences\" between the original executive order and the new one, but ultimately concluded this particular Syrian family faces \"a significant risk of irreparable harm\" given \"the daily threats to the lives plaintiff's wife and child remaining in Aleppo, Syria.\" As result, the judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking application of the new travel ban in this particular case, but not for any other families. A federal judge in Maryland has also set a hearing on Wednesday morning to hear another challenge brought by refugee aid groups and several foreign nationals. They allege that many foreign nationals, including those from the six banned countries and refugees, have family in the US and will suffer \"as a result of the delaying reuniting with their family members.\" Finally, a lawsuit was filed by a private attorney on behalf of the \"people of California,\" according to court documents last week. But it was not filed by the state attorney general's office and unclear whether the judge will allow the case to proceed. A similar lawsuit filed after the original ban was announced, but was quickly dismissed.

But will the changes be enough to persuade federal judges? The President's ink was barely dry before challengers, including immigrant rights groups, the ACLU and state attorneys general, reacted swiftly, treating the new ban as very similar to the last one. Challengers are preparing their own next steps and hinting that while the changes are substantial, they still have deep reservations about the new travel ban. \"The Trump administration has conceded that its original Muslim ban was indefensible,\" said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. \"Unfortunately, it has replaced it with a scaled-back version that shares the same fatal flaws.\" Jadwat and others say the \"only way to actually fix the Muslim ban is not to have a Muslim ban.\" They will press some of the same issues they have made before, including religious discrimination claims, questions about the urgency of an order and a request for national security evidence to back up the administration's claims about the countries at issue. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who is behind a challenge that is furthest along in the courts, said at a press conference Monday that the new order is \"drastically narrowed\" and that it is \"too soon to say what we are going to do.\" Although the new order does not go into effect until March 16, already it has triggered a new flurry of legal documents. The Justice Department filed notices in federal courts alerting the judges to the new order and making clear that the government believes the new order \"falls outside of\" injunctions that blocked the original ban. The government cited the changes including the fact that the new order does not apply to green card holders or those with valid visas. But courts that took up the original ban have plenty of issues to look at. Due Process The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals last month expressed due process concerns about the impact of the order, especially when it came to green card holders. The \"government has failed to establish that lawful permanent residents have no due process rights when seeking to re-enter the United States,\" the judges wrote. The new order makes crystal clear that green card holders should not be impacted by the ban. The administration also made clear that those with valid visas who found themselves caught in a legal \"no man's land\" in airports after the first order would also not be affected. But Ferguson said he still had reservations outside of the realm of due process. \"The intent behind the original order is of deep concern for us,\" he said, adding, \"I do not take lightly suing the President of the United States.\" Urgency One thing challengers are sure to attack is the fact that the administration argues there are urgent reasons for the ban. But it waited several weeks after the original version to issue a new order, and the new one doesn't take effect until March 16. During a background briefing on Monday, an administration official said that the time lapse was due in part to the legal tangles prompted by federal judges who were \"substituting\" their judgment for that of the executive. However, the White House was ready to release the new ban last week, but delayed the announcement after the President's speech to Congress got a better reception than anticipated. Religious Discrimination Administration officials in a briefing with reporters Monday stressed that the executive order was \"not in any way ... a Muslim ban. ... [W]e want to make sure everyone understands that.\" But US federal Judge Leonie M. Brinkema issued a strong rebuke on February 13 in a different case before her court, holding that there was a strong likelihood that challengers \"will prevail on the merits of its Establishment Clause claim.\" And Brinkema used Trump's comments on the campaign against him. \"The 'Muslim ban' was a centerpiece of the President's campaign for months, and the press release calling for it was still available on his website as of the day this memorandum opinion is being entered,\" she wrote. The release remains available as of March 6. After the order came down on Monday, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, who won a preliminary injunction against the ban, issued a statement. \"Although the new order appears to be significantly scaled back, it still sends a horrible message to the world, to Muslim-Americans, and to minority communities across the country, without any demonstrable benefit to national security,\" he said. National Security As Sessions unveiled the new ban, he revealed some new national security information. \"Today more than 300 people who came here as refugees are under FBI investigation for potential terrorism-related activities,\" he said. The statement was likely in response to a footnote in the 9th US Circuit Court's opinion criticizing the government for failing to put forward national security information to justify the ban. \"Courts regularly receive classified information under seal and maintain its confidentiality,\" the judges said. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell Law School professor, said he expects the challenges to continue. \"Overall, the revised executive order is essentially old wine in a new bottle,\" he said. \"Analysis in the intelligence unit at the Department of Homeland Security found little evidence that citizens of the seven countries included in the original travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States,\" Yale-Loehr said. For now, because of the delayed start date, lawyers are considering their options.

Trump's new executive order bans foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and bans all refugees for 120 days. But unlike his original executive order from January, those with green cards or valid visas are exempted from the ban. Despite these changes, several states and immigration advocates say the new order still suffers from legal flaws and have asked federal judges to weigh in by issuing temporary restraining orders blocking the ban before Thursday. Courts in Maryland and Hawaii agreed to hear oral arguments from both sides Wednesday and could issue decisions the same day. Here are the issues at play: How different is the new executive order? Despite the fact that the President's senior policy adviser said the revised travel ban would have \"mostly minor technical differences\" from the iteration previously blocked by the courts, the Justice Department's position is crystal clear: the new executive order is \"substantially different.\" DOJ has argued in legal filings this week that challengers to the new order have no legal claim because: visa holders are now protected and exempted from the travel ban, the only foreigners who are excluded have no constitutional right to enter the US, and the new executive order contains \"robust waiver provisions,\" granting entry on a case-by-case basis for those who do not pose a national security risk, in any event. Yet several states have urged judges to see that the new order still contains a 90-day ban on foreign nationals from Muslim-majority countries and a 120-day ban on all refugees -- two aspects of the old executive order that were explicitly suspended by federal courts. \"[T]he revised executive order is essentially old wine in a new bottle,\" said Cornell Law School Professor Stephen Yale-Loehr. \"It assumes that travelers from the six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees are inherent security risks.\" In other words, the sticking point in the new executive order could come down to whether a judge agrees -- at least for the limited purposes of a restraining order blocking the order's implementation temporarily -- that the challengers have sufficiently shown that it discriminates on the basis of religion. Last time around, at least one federal judge in Virginia took note of Trump's campaign trail statements calling for a \"complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\" and concluded that the state had produced \"unrebutted evidence\" that the travel ban \"was not motivated by rational national security concerns,\" but \"religious prejudice\" against Muslims. DOJ strongly disagrees with any such reading of the new executive order. \"(The) text and purpose (of the new executive order) are explicitly religion neutral, and it no longer grants any preference for victims of religious persecution,\" Justice Department attorneys argued in a court filing Monday. Can states still sue? Several of the states challenging the new executive order claim that it harms tourism and negatively affects foreign students for public universities. The Justice Department says that argument is \"mere speculation.\" For instance, \"Hawaii does not identify any particular persons it seeks to recruit who have concrete plans to relocate to Hawaii and join a state university or agency -- let alone specific plans to do so in the next 90 days,\" DOJ attorneys argue in legal briefs. \"Rather, the most Hawaii can say is that unidentified aliens might aspire to do so someday.\" Yet the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which tackled this threshold issue when evaluating the first executive order, saw no problem to states bringing the lawsuits -- at least for the initial stages of litigation. \"The necessary connection can be drawn in at most two logical steps: (1) the Executive Order prevents nationals of seven countries from entering Washington and Minnesota; (2) as a result, some of these people will not enter state universities, some will not join those universities as faculty, some will be prevented from performing research, and some will not be permitted to return if they leave,\" the appellate court wrote. The question is whether courts this time will agree, especially since students or faculty members with existing valid visas are excluded from the new travel ban. Confusion at airports again? When the new executive order was signed last week, administration officials told reporters that the new order included a 10-day \"phase-in\" period to ensure that those traveling \"aren't placed in legal jeopardy,\" and in the hopes of avoiding the \"chaos\" seen at airports after the first travel ban was signed. But now that judges have scheduled hearings to hear challenges to the new order Wednesday -- just hours before it is slated to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Thursday -- travelers at airports could experience confusion once again if any judge blocks the new order, either in full or in part. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. But immigrant rights groups say they are prepared and will have attorneys stationed at airports if travelers experience any problems.

Lawyers in Virginia are gearing up for a hearing in court Friday morning on the state attorney general's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the travel ban nationwide. The state argues that the central provisions of President Donald Trump's executive order -- barring citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days and temporarily cutting off refugee admissions -- are unconstitutional. As of now, those provisions of the executive order remain temporarily suspended nationwide because of a decision issued by US District Court Judge James Robart in Seattle last Friday. As a result, foreign travelers from the seven banned Muslim-majority countries have been allowed to enter the US -- for now. The 9th Circuit is expected to rule Thursday evening, and if it flatly denies the government's request to reinstate the travel ban, Robart's order suspending the travel ban will remain in place. The Virginia case could potentially provide an extra layer of longer-term protection since Robart's order was only temporary. But if the the 9th Circuit grants the Justice Department's motion to stop Robart's suspension of the executive order, or limits its terms in any way that reinstates the travel ban, then what happens in Virginia on Friday could quickly become a game-changer.

Here are seven big takeaways from their unanimous, 29-page opinion: 1. The three judges believe they are well within their rights to check the president's authority on matters of immigration and national security, and the government's suggestion to the contrary is undemocratic \"Instead, the Government has taken the position that the President's decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections. The Government indeed asserts that it violates separation of powers for the judiciary to entertain a constitutional challenge to executive actions such as this one. There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.\" 2. The court isn't buying -- as Trump has suggested -- that the impact of the order was limited to extra vetting for 109 people. \"The impact of the Executive Order was immediate and widespread. It was reported that thousands of visas were immediately canceled, hundreds of travelers with such visas were prevented from boarding airplanes bound for the United States or denied entry on arrival, and some travelers were detained.\" 3. The court thinks the states of Washington and Minnesota have actual harms they can sue over. \"Specifically, the States allege that the teaching and research missions of their universities are harmed by the Executive Order's effect on their faculty and students who are nationals of the seven affected countries. These students and faculty cannot travel for research, academic collaboration, or for personal reasons, and their families abroad cannot visit. Some have been stranded outside the country, unable to return to the universities at all. The schools cannot consider attractive student candidates and cannot hire faculty from the seven affected countries, which they have done in the past.\" 4. The court isn't sure -- at this stage -- whether there is proof that the executive order discriminates against Muslims. \"The States' claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions. In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the Government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed.\" 5. The court doesn't believe the government needs to immediately reinstate the ban to protect national security. \"The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree, as explained above.\" 6. The government says green-card holders aren't impacted by the order anymore, because of guidance from the White House counsel. The court says it can't take that to the bank. \"Nor has the Government established that the White House counsel's interpretation of the Executive Order is binding on all executive branch officials responsible for enforcing the Executive Order. The White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments. Moreover, in light of the Government's shifting interpretations of the Executive Order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.\" 7. The court wouldn't even give the government its fallback position -- a modification of the earlier judge's suspension of the ban \"More generally, even if the [temporary restraining order] might be overbroad in some respects, it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order. The political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions. For now, it is enough for us to conclude that the Government has failed to establish that it will likely succeed on its due process argument in this appeal.\"", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-02-09", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 399, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Trump travel ban oral arguments: what you need to know", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/trump-travel-ban-oral-arguments-what-you-need-to-know/index.html", "text": "(CNN) Three federal judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals are set to hear oral arguments at 6 p.m. ET Tuesday in the challenge to President Donald Trump's travel ban. The lawsuit, brought by attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota, has captivated the nation since last Friday when a federal district court judge put a stop to Trump's executive order restricting travel for foreign nationals, and as a result, temporarily opened US borders to immigrants once again. The hearing will be by telephone and livestreamed; here's what to listen for: What's the hearing about? US District Court Judge James Robart upended Trump's executive order nationwide Friday by temporarily halting the key provisions restricting travel for foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen) and refugee admissions. The central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban. No court has addressed the constitutionality of the executive order thus far. The players The attorney general of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, filed the case and was later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota, Lori Swanson. The suit is being defended by lawyers at the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, DC. The randomly assigned three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland; who was appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush. When is this hearing? The appellate court has set an hour-long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET. It will be available for live streaming through the court's website Each side will get 30 minutes to make their case. What are the states saying? On Monday attorneys for the states that filed the lawsuit submitted their brief urging the appellate court to keep the travel ban suspension in place. The states say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had \"unleashed chaos\" by signing the order. They also argue that the government's claim -- that it would be \"irreparably harmed\" by keeping Robart's temporary suspension order in place while the case proceeds to the merits -- doesn't make any sense. To accept DOJ's position, they argue, \"would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some, unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. That makes no sense. ...Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\" What is the Trump administration's argument? The government submitted its own brief in response Monday evening. DOJ continues to emphasize that the states do not have the ability to sue in this case and a district court judge does not have the right to second-guess the President's national security judgment in the immigration context. But the government also raised a fallback argument in its latest court filing -- suggesting if the appellate court is inclined to uphold the Seattle district court's decision, then it must at least limit it to the class of people who have been previously admitted to the US -- like someone traveling on a student visa. In the government's view, aliens outside of the US who have never stepped foot on US soil have no constitutional right to enter the US. What happens next? The judges have a number of different options at their disposal to resolve this case, but it is unlikely that they would rule on whether the ban is constitutional (since that is not the question before them) -- the central issue is whether the executive order should remain suspended for now. For example, the judges could dismiss DOJ's request for a stay of Robart's decision because, as the government acknowledges, temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable, or they could uphold his ruling -- but under either scenario the suspension of the ban would remain in place while the case moves forward with further scheduled hearings. Alternatively, the appellate court could find Robart abused his discretion and overreached to include classes of people not protected under the Constitution (e.g., aliens living abroad) -- in which case the travel ban would go back into effect. After the three-judge panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court (but is not required to do so in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court). Given the high stakes involved in this lawsuit, it is expected that whoever ultimately loses before the Ninth Circuit will most likely appeal to the Supreme Court. At the moment, there are only eight justices on the court, meaning if there is a 4-4 split then the Ninth Circuit's ruling will be the law of the land.", "top_words": ["executive", "travel", "case", "trump", "ban", "know", "judge", "court", "appellate", "president", "temporary", "need", "order", "arguments", "oral"], "summary": "ET Tuesday in the challenge to President Donald Trump's travel ban.\nThe central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban.\nThe appellate court has set an hour-long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p.m.\nOn Monday attorneys for the states that filed the lawsuit submitted their brief urging the appellate court to keep the travel ban suspension in place.\nTo accept DOJ's position, they argue, \"would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some, unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm.", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": ["laura jarrett"], "id": "232", "author_string": "laura jarrett"}, {"title": "9th Circuit Court of Appeals to hear challenge to Trump's ban Tuesday", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/06/politics/9th-circuit-court-of-appeals-trump-travel-ban/index.html", "text": "(CNN) Three federal judges Tuesday evening will hear oral arguments in the challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. The hour-long hearing, conducted by telephone among three West coast judges at 6 p.m. ET, will determine the immediate fate of the nationwide temporary restraining order against Trump's travel ban. Trump has only been in office for 17 days, but his Justice Department is already embroiled in a high-stakes legal battle that could affect hundreds of thousands of people and the direction of his presidency. Attorneys general for Washington and Minnesota, which challenged the executive order, say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had \"unleashed chaos\" by signing the order. Trump, who rode a wave of populist anger into the White House, now has to wait for the Ninth Circuit panel. The San Francisco-based court has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation to the point where some Republican lawmakers have even pushed to split it up in an effort to limit its impact. And no matter what its ruling here, the next stop will likely be the US Supreme Court. It's a stunning escalation of an issue that has caused massive confusion in airports across the country, left those with valid visas and refugees seeking asylum in legal limbo and prompted the President himself -- in the first major legal challenge of his presidency -- to launch an attack on one judge who ruled against him. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday evening commented on Trump's attack: \"My mother and father raised me to be gracious in victory and defeat as a kid. Based on those tweets it appears to me that's a lesson that's been lost on President Trump.\" Not a constitutional challenge The issue in front of the court at the moment is not whether or not Trump's travel ban is constitutional, but whether it will remain suspended for now. It all centers on his executive order issued January 27 with little explanation or advance warning. The order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Friday, federal Judge James Robart of the US District Court for the Western District of Washington suspended key parts of the executive order nationwide . Trump fired off two tweets in response . In one he referred to Robart as a \"so called\" judge. In another, he said, \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" The two states' attorneys general put forward several legal arguments, including that it violates the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution because it shows government preference for one religion over another, and Equal Protection Clause -- part of the 14th Amendment -- because it discriminates based on religion and national origin. The government counters that Robart's injunction should be lifted for now and the executive order should be cleared to go back into effect while the legal process continues. \"The Executive Order is a lawful exercise of the President's authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees,\" the lawyers wrote in briefs filed Monday night. They argued that the district court \"erred\" in entering a \"sweeping nationwide injunction.\" They argued that Congress has granted the President \"broad discretion\" to suspend \"any class of aliens\" into the United States. But they acknowledged that if the Court were to allow the injunction to stand it should be limited to the class of individuals on whom the State's claims rest: \"previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\" Amicus brief from Kerry, Albright Also on Monday morning several former senior US officials, including former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, signed on to a declaration in support of a brief filed by the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota. \"We view the (Executive) Order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,\" officials wrote. \"It could do long-term damage to our national security and foreign policy interest, endangering US troops in the field and disrupting counterterrorism and national security partnerships.\" Amicus brief from 16 state attorneys general The top legal officials in 16 states, including Pennsylvania and Iowa which voted for Trump, filed a memorandum in support of efforts to halt the travel ban . The state attorneys general from these states argue they have standing as the executive order inflicts harm on states, including disruption at state universities and medical institutions. The states include New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont, the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. Government briefs due Monday evening The appellate court has been burning the midnight oil, requesting further briefing early Sunday on the Justice Department's request for an emergency stay from the two states -- Washington and Minnesota -- as well as from the government. The states ask that the court to leave the temporary restraining order in place, arguing that the government has failed to show that it would be \"irreparably harmed\" by a suspension of the executive order. \"But that would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. That makes no sense. ... Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties,\" the states said in a court filing Monday morning. Monday evening, the Justice Department responded. \"The Executive Order is a lawful exercise of the President's authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees,\" the Justice Department wrote in a brief Monday evening. Ferguson responded to the filing saying: \"There's nothing in there that's particularly surprising.\" JUST WATCHED Executive orders: One thing you need to know Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Executive orders: One thing you need to know 00:53 The government struck back Sunday, arguing that Robart's order should be lifted and the executive order go back into effect. \"Judicial second-guessing of the President's determination that a temporary suspension of entry of certain classes of aliens was necessary at this time to protect national security would constitute an impermissible intrusion on the political branches' plenary constitutional authority over foreign affairs, national security, and immigration,\" wrote Noel Francisco, the acting Solicitor General. The three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush. It is likely that they will make their decisions based on the legal briefs they receive and not ask for a hearing. The 9th Circuit represents the most geographically diverse district in the country with nearly four dozen judges and covers most of the western United States, Hawaii and Alaska. The loser at the 9th Circuit will most likely go to the Supreme Court. Because the justices are understaffed with only eight judges, there is a chance that they could split on the ruling 4-4. If that were to occur, they'd be left with simply upholding whatever order the 9th Circuit issued, underscoring the importance of that court's ruling. Hawaii rejected Hawaii had filed an emergency motion to intervene in the appeal as well alongside Minnesota and Washington, an attempt the court rejected Monday night. The state's attorney general filed a separate lawsuit against Trump over the travel ban in federal district court in Hawaii last week, and it argued that Hawaii must be allowed in the case before the Ninth Circuit to protect its interests as well.", "top_words": ["executive", "hear", "national", "ban", "circuit", "challenge", "appeals", "judge", "court", "9th", "united", "states", "trumps", "general", "order", "president", "legal"], "summary": "(CNN) Three federal judges Tuesday evening will hear oral arguments in the challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration.\nIt all centers on his executive order issued January 27 with little explanation or advance warning.\nThey argued that Congress has granted the President \"broad discretion\" to suspend \"any class of aliens\" into the United States.\n\"But that would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm.\nThe 9th Circuit represents the most geographically diverse district in the country with nearly four dozen judges and covers most of the western United States, Hawaii and Alaska.", "source": "cnn", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": ["ariane de vogue"], "id": "222", "author_string": "ariane de vogue"}, {"title": "Trump says he'll issue a new executive order on immigration by next week", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-travel-ban-20170216-story.html", "text": "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will issue a new executive order on immigration by next week, and Justice Department lawyers asked a federal appeals court to hold off on taking action in the legal battle over his initial travel ban until that new order is in place. In a news conference at the White House, Trump said the new order would \"comprehensively protect our country,\" and he hinted that it might contain new vetting measures for travelers. Trump's first order temporarily barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from entering the United States, ostensibly so officials could review and tighten screening procedures. \"Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places,\" Trump said. He said the administration \"had to go quicker than we thought\" because a federal appeals court refused to lift the suspension on his travel ban. The president's comments and the Justice Department's request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit mean that the administration - at least for now - is pumping the brakes on the furious court battle to restore the travel ban. Instead, the administration indicated in its filing that it expects that a revamped executive order will eliminate judges' concerns, even those the Justice Department views as unfounded. The 9th Circuit agreed late Thursday to wait until a new order was issued to potentially reconsider the matter before a larger group of judges. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had successfully sued to block the travel ban, wrote on Twitter that the Justice Department filing, in particular, \"recognizes the obvious - the President's current Exec Order violates the Constitution.\" \"President Trump could have sought review of this flawed Order in the Supreme Court but declined to face yet another defeat,\" Ferguson wrote. The legal wrangling, though, is far from over, and even a new executive order will not necessarily end the need for it. What happens next will largely depend on how significantly the rewritten order departs from the original. Justice Department lawyers wrote that the revisions would be meaningful. \"Rather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the Order and replace it with a new, substantially revised Executive Order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns,\" the lawyers wrote. \"In so doing, the President will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially time-consuming litigation.\" Trump could make clear that his order no longer applies to green-card holders - who probably have the strongest case to sue - or he could craft an order that would affect only people who have not yet applied for visas. But a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said even those modifications would not necessarily persuade them to lift a suspension of the ban, because such changes would not help U.S. citizens who \"have an interest in specific noncitizens' ability to travel to the United States.\" Lee Gelernt, who is deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's national Immigrants' Rights Project and is involved in another legal challenge to Trump's order in federal court in New York, said it is difficult to assess a new order without seeing it, \"but I think any type of ban is going to be legally problematic, and I also don't think that the taint of religious discrimination is going to go away.\" The original executive order, signed Jan. 27, barred refugees from entering the country for 120 days; citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days; and citizens of Syria indefinitely. A federal judge in Seattle first ordered the ban suspended Feb. 3, and the three-judge panel with the 9th Circuit last week unanimously rejected the administration's request to undo that freeze. That left Justice Department lawyers with two options in the short run: rush immediately to the Supreme Court, or ask the full 9th Circuit to take up the matter in what is known as a rehearing \"en banc.\" They had yet to make a choice when a judge on the 9th Circuit asked the judges to take a vote on their own, and the circuit's chief judge asked the parties to file their positions on the matter by Thursday. The Justice Department, representing the Trump administration, argued in its filing that the three-judge panel was wrong, but - given that a new executive order was coming anyway - the 9th Circuit should hold off on taking up the matter en banc. Washington state and Minnesota, which are suing over the ban, also argued against en banc consideration, but they asserted that the three-judge panel got it right. At issue has not been whether Trump's ban is ultimately legal - although that has been part of the consideration. The judges have been asked to consider only whether national security concerns necessitate an immediate restoration of the travel ban, when weighed against the economic and other harms Washington and Minnesota officials say it is imposing on their states. The president has broad authority to set immigration policy, but federal judges nationwide have ruled against Trump's particular travel ban. This week, a federal judge in Virginia handed down perhaps the most stinging rebuke of the executive order, declaring that there was evidence that it was motivated not by national security concerns but instead by \"religious prejudice\" toward Muslims.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 373, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "In court filing, Trump administration suggests it won't go to Supreme Court over travel ban -- for now", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-in-court-filing-trump-administration-1487019471-htmlstory.html", "text": "In a filing subitted to a Seattle federal court on Monday, the Department of Justice suggested it would not immediately turn to the U.S. Supreme Court to ask for the Trump administration's travel moratorium to be reinstated after an appeals court dealt a blow to it last week. In the filing, Acting Assistant Atty. Gen. Chad Readler told the U.S. District Court in western Washington that the department wanted to see how the case over the travel ban plays out in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals before proceeding with the case in the lower court. It's the Seattle court where Judge James L. Robart on Feb. 3 called for a temporary nationwide halt to Trump's travel ban, which the White House appealed to the 9th Circuit. Last week, three 9th Circuit judges upheld Robart's decision. But then a judge from the full appeals court of 25 active judges asked for the wider court to vote on whether an en banc panel -- 11 judges -- should reconsider the government's request to reinstate the travel ban. Under court rules, the judge who made that request will remain anonymous. Legal scholars say the makeup of the 9th Circuit makes it its unlikely that the court will vote differently if it reconsiders the government's request. The court has set a deadline of 11 a.m. Thursday for briefs on whether it should vote for an en banc panel. The Seattle court and the 9th Circuit have not decided on the constitutionality of the travel ban but have only said it would do irreparable harm if it was reinstated while its constitutionality is decided. Trump could ask the Supreme Court to vote on whether the ban should go forward while lower courts deliberate constitutional questions. Last week, White House officials first signaled that they would not go to the nation's highest court, and then said they were still open to the idea. But the court filing on Monday -- which does not rule out the Supreme Court option-- suggests the White House will avoid going to it for the time being because it wants to see if the 9th Circuit would be open to reconsidering its earlier decision on the ban. Trump has also said he could sign a new executive order on immigration, which could allow him to circumvent some of the current court fights but possibly open him up to new ones. If signed, it's expected a new order would be more limited than the current one, which declares a moratorium on travel from nationals of seven mostly Muslim countries, temporarily suspends the admission of refugees and indefinitely bars Syrian refugees. Meanwhile, the states of Washington and Minnesota, which had brought the Seattle case against Trump, also made a new filing in the district court on Monday. The states argue that the case in Seattle should proceed so the constitutionality of the travel ban can be determined.

The government will ask a federal appeals court to restore the administration's executive order, contending that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States. But several states have challenged the ban and insisted that Trump's executive order is unconstitutional. Tuesday's hearing was to unfold before a randomly selected panel of judges from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Whatever the appeals court decides, either side could ask the Supreme Court to intervene. Seattle U.S. District Judge James Robart, who on Friday temporarily blocked Trump's order, has said a judge's job is to ensure that an action taken by the government \"comports with our country's laws.\" Trump said Tuesday that he can't believe his administration has to fight in the courts to uphold his refugee and immigration ban, a policy he says will protect the country. \"And a lot of people agree with us, believe me,\" Trump said at a roundtable discussion with members of the National Sheriff's Association. \"If those people ever protested, you'd see a real protest. But they want to see our borders secure and our country secure.\" On Monday, the Justice Department filed a new defense of the ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Lawyers said the ban was a \"lawful exercise\" of the president's authority to protect national security and said Robart's order should be overruled. The filing with the appeals court was the latest salvo in a high-stakes legal fight surrounding Trump's order. Alexander F.

Kennedy International Airport in New York on Feb. 5, 2017. (Alexander F. Yuan / AP) (Alexander F. Yuan / AP) Washington state, Minnesota and other states say the appellate court should allow a temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban to stand as their lawsuit moves through the legal system. The panel hearing the arguments includes two Democrat-appointed judges and one Republican appointee. The appeals court over the weekend refused to immediately reinstate the ban, and lawyers for Washington and Minnesota argued anew on Monday that any resumption would \"unleash chaos again,\" separating families and stranding university students. The Justice Department responded that the president has clear authority to \"suspend the entry of any class of aliens\" to the U.S. in the name of national security. It said the travel ban, which temporarily suspends the country's refugee program and immigration from seven countries with terrorism concerns, was intended \"to permit an orderly review and revision of screening procedures to ensure that adequate standards are in place to protect against terrorist attacks.\" The challengers of the ban were asking \"courts to take the extraordinary step of second-guessing a formal national security judgment made by the president himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority,\" the Justice Department wrote. It's possible that the panel could make a ruling on a technical point, rather than the larger merits of the case. Under 9th Circuit case law, temporary restraining orders cannot be appealed, a point noted by the states in their briefing to the court. An analysis on that point would include examining whether the lower court's order is properly classified as a temporary restraining order rather than as another type of order, a preliminary injunction, noted Arthur Hellman, a federal courts scholar at University of Pittsburgh Law School. If the case does end up before the Supreme Court, it could prove difficult to find the necessary five votes to undo a lower court order. The Supreme Court has been at less than full strength since Justice Antonin Scalia's death a year ago. The last immigration case that reached the justices ended in a 4-4 tie. How and when a case might get to the Supreme Court is unclear. The travel ban itself is to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before a higher court takes up the issue. Or the administration could change it in any number of ways that would keep the issue alive. After Robart's ruling, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 with valid visas could travel to the U.S. On Monday, a graduate student who had traveled to Libya with her 1-year-old son to visit her sick mother and attend her father's funeral was back in Fort Collins, Colorado, after having been stopped in Jordan on her return trip. She was welcomed with flowers and balloons by her husband and other children. Syrian immigrant Mathyo Asali said he thought his life was \"ruined\" when he landed at Philadelphia International Airport on Jan. 28 only to be denied entry to the United States. Asali, who returned to Damascus, said he figured he'd be inducted into the Syrian military. He was back on U.S. soil Monday. \"It's really nice to know that there's a lot of people supporting us,\" Asali told Gov. Tom Wolf, who greeted the family at a relative's house in Allentown. States challenging the ban have been joined by technology companies, who have said it makes it more difficult to recruit employees. National security officials under President Barack Obama have also come out against it.

The 9th Circuit has told government lawyers they have 14 days if they want to respond to the decision from three judges who refused to stay a temporary restraining order issued from a lower court judge blocking enforcement of the travel ban while the case is decided. The government could ask for reconsideration from the same judges, or from a larger group of 11 judges. But with what appear to be slim chances of getting the ban reinstated by the appeals court, it's unclear whether the Justice Department would try either option, said UC Irvine Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. It may not have to. On Friday, a judge on the appeals court made a request that the full court of 25 active judges vote on whether it should on its own -- without a motion from Trump's lawyers -- reconsider the decision from the court's motions panel. The court has set an deadline of 11 a.m. on February 16 for briefs on that question. In the meantime, U.S. district Judge James L. Robart in Seattle, who a week ago issued the restraining order that halted Trump's travel ban nationwide, has ordered lawyers from the Department of Justice and the states of Washington and Minnesota to submit a joint report to the court by Sunday night about how the case should proceed. The question at this point: Does it go back to Robart's court to decide whether his temporary restraining order should be turned into a full preliminary injunction, which would have the effect of extending the order banning enforcement of the travel ban for a longer period? Or does the 9th Circuit's ruling, as lawyers for the state of Washington have suggested, already have the effect of a preliminary injunction? The judge has scheduled a telephone conference with lawyers on the case at 11 a.m. Pacific on Monday to discuss next steps. \"You're seeing each court going about its business, not knowing what will happen in other courts,\" Chemerinsky said. \"The federal court is saying, 'Tell me, each side, what should we do next?' The 9th Circuit is giving the standard amount of time for Trump to ask for reconsideration.\" Meanwhile, judges and lawyers around the country, who are scheduled for hearings over dozens of lawsuits filed over Trump's travel order, also are sorting through how their cases should proceed in the wake of the 9th Circuit's decision. At a Friday hearing at an Alexandria, Va., federal court over the state of Virginia's suit against Trump, a federal lawyer indicated the government had not decided on how to reply to Thursday's ruling. \"We may appeal. We may not,\" Department of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni said to U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema. \"All options are being considered.\" Brinkema, who said that the executive order \"has all kinds of defects\" and \"clearly is overreaching,\" demanded evidence from the government that the travel ban was needed. \"The courts have been begging you to provide some evidence, and none has been forthcoming,\" she said.", "source": "latimes", "publish_date": "2017-03-24", "authors": ["jaweed kaleem"], "type": "article", "id": 121, "author_string": "jaweed kaleem"}, {"title": "Supreme Court order may cause travel chaos", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/26/politics/supreme-court-order-may-cause-travel-chaos/index.html", "text": "Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court's decision green-lighting parts of President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban Monday saved many of the prickly questions about the constitutionality of the executive order for another day -- but legal experts say that the court's compromise ruling raises other more practical headaches (and potentially further litigation) for travelers this summer. \"Today's order will create more confusion, delays, and litigation,\" says Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School. Here's a look at why. 1. Roll-out plan unclear When the Trump administration rolled out the President's first executive order in January, bedlam ensued almost immediately as foreigners from seven predominately Muslim countries tried to enter the US, only to be turned away at the border or separated from loved ones abroad. This time around, the ban will not go into effect immediately. The President -- perhaps looking ahead to a potential court victory -- signed a memorandum earlier this month directing administration officials to begin implementation of the permitted parts of the travel ban 72 hours after the court gives the okay. So when exactly does the clock begin to run? The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on precise timing or a detailed roll-out plan, but said in a statement Monday that implementation will be done with \"clear and sufficient public notice, particularly to potentially affected travelers.\" 2. How bona fide is bona fide? The test for prospective travelers under the Supreme Court's new decision is whether one has a \"credible claim of bona fide relationship\" with either an entity or person living in the US -- if you do, you can come to the US; if you don't, you are banned for 90 days if you are from Libya, Syria, Iran, Somalia, Yemen and Sudan (and 120 days if you are a refugee). Justices offered several examples of scenarios in which travel ban shouldn't apply -- such as a foreign national who wishes to live with a family member in the US or a student accepted to an American university -- but what if the individual's connection to the US is more attenuated or not as well defined? \"It all depends on what the relationship is and when it is initiated,\" explained Yale-Loehr. \"If a person thinking about applying to become a refugee emails a church in the US and says 'please sponsor me to become a refugee,' that would not qualify as a bona fide relationship, in my view.\" But immigrant rights activists and leaders of refugee resettlement organizations said Monday that based on their reading of the ruling, thousands of refugees should still be able to come to the United States.

MUST WATCH Swalwell: SCOTUS ruling makes U.S. less safe 03:36 \"The hope is that this really only impacts a very small number of people,\" said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. Melanie Nezer, senior vice president for public affairs of HIAS, told reporters that the refugee resettlement agency is trying to reassure its clients who are already in the pipeline. Many of them have family ties in the United States, she said, and have established relationships with US-based resettlement organizations. The court made clear that nonprofits may not initiate contact with foreign nationals from the banned countries to secure their entry into the country, but left open is whether previous contact between refugees and resettlement agencies in the US counts as sufficiently \"bona fide.\" \"They have extensive ties here, and it would be hard to say that they don't,\" Nezer said. \"This decision makes a strong statement that ties are important, that being in the process still matters, and that the US is not looking to break its promises toward people it's offered resettlement to.\" 3. Even more lawsuits? Other experts say that the Supreme Court's decision provides greater discretion to consular officers and border agents. \"Think about how the people at the border, at airports are going to make that decision,\" said CNN legal analyst Page Pate. \"Who is going to make this decision? If we leave it to the folks on the front line, that's just going to lead to more litigation.\" At least three justices agreed the standard used by the court will prove \"unworkable\" in practice and invite a \"flood of litigation\" over the summer as \"courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a 'bona fide relationship.'\" The dissent from Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch argued the travel ban should be fully implemented. \"How individuals will prove such a (bona fide) relationship, and whether the burden of proof will be on the government or the individuals seeking entry, remains to be seen,\" Yale-Loehr agreed. \"I predict chaos at the border and new lawsuits as foreign nationals and refugees argue that they are entitled to enter the United States.\" Except this time, the confusion will have been of the court's own making.

The court is allowing the ban to go into effect for foreign nationals who lack any \"bona fide relationship with any person or entity in the United States.\" The court, in an unsigned opinion, left the travel ban against citizens of six majority-Muslim on hold as applied to non-citizens with relationships with persons or entities in the United States, which includes most of the plaintiffs in both cases. Examples of formal relationships include students accepted to US universities and an employee who has accepted a job with a company in the US, the court said. This is the first time the high court has weighed in on the travel ban, and a partial victory for the Trump administration, which has been fighting lower court rulings blocking the ban from taking effect. Justices did not address Trump's tweets which have caused legal problems for his administration previously. The ban, which bars people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days -- outside of the \"bona fide\" relationship exception -- could take effect in as little as 72 hours. Trump called the decision \"a clear victory for our national security.\" \"As President, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm,\" he added in a statement. \"I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive.\" What's next? How officials implement the ban could cause chaos at airports, similar to what happened when Trump's first travel ban executive order was written in January (it was later blocked). \"That's going to be an extreme headache. Think about how the people at the border, at airports are going to make that decision,\" said Page Pate, CNN legal analyst. \"Who is going to make this decision? If we leave it to the folks on the front line, that's just going to lead to more litigation.\" Trump signed a memorandum earlier this month which states that administration officials shall begin implementation of the parts of the order that are allowed to go forward 72 hours after the court rules. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it will discuss the court's action with the Justice and State departments and said it would implement the ban \"professionally, with clear and sufficient public notice, particularly to potentially affected travelers, and in coordination with partners in the travel industry.\" As for refugees, the court held that a person seeking refuge in the US can claim \"concrete hardship\" -- but in the end, if they \"lack any such connection to the United States ... the balance tips in favor of the government's compelling need to provide for the Nation's security.\" Sidesteps Trump's tweets Trump himself has repeatedly criticized judges who sided against the travel ban and suggested the judicial system is against him and harming national security interests. \"That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people,\" Trump tweeted earlier this month That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017 This is Trump's second attempt to install a travel ban. The first executive order was issued one week into his term, and sought to bar people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. After it was blocked by the courts, Trump tried again in March with a revised version that didn't include Iraq and was meant to clarify problems of the first order that created uncertainty about the rights of dual citizens and holders of US visas. It had been blocked by courts on both constitutional and statutory grounds. But while lower courts used Trump's own words against the White House as a justification to stop the ban from taking effect, the high court did not look at that language. Candidate Trump issued a statement calling for the \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering the United States until the government could \"figure out what is going on,\" in response to a deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by ISIS sympathizers in December 2015. \"The 16 pages did not include any citations to President Trump's campaign rhetoric,\" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"And the Supreme Court seems reluctant to get into the business of that, which is why I always thought the President had the best chance of winning at the Supreme Court.\" \"This is about the executive order itself. It is not about the campaign or anything else,\" Toobin added. Conservative trio would have allowed full ban Justice Clarence Thomas dissented with Justice Samuel Alito and newly-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch, saying the court didn't go far enough. Thomas said he would have stayed the injunctions \"in full,\" adding the government is \"likely to succeed on the merits.\" Thomas expressed concern with the \"court's remedy\" and said he fears it will \"prove unworkable.\" \"Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding -- on peril of contempt -- whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,\" he said. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy -- who has been considering retirement -- both joined the majority opinion that agreed to keep parts of the ban on hold until oral arguments this fall. That fact is telling, said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law \"The fact that neither agreed with the dissenters to put the full Executive Order into effect may be an important signal for how they'd be likely to rule on the merits -- and a bad sign for the Trump administration at least with respect to no -- citizens with connections to the United States,\" Vladeck said. Toobin also suggested how the court handled the case means Kennedy will stick around. \"The fact that Kennedy didn't retire today probably means he won't retire this term,\" Toobin said. \"However, Sandra Day O'Connor did retire two days after the term ended.\" This story has been updated.", "top_words": ["parts", "travel", "trump", "allows", "ban", "supreme", "court", "order", "united", "term", "trumps", "states", "effect"], "summary": "Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court Monday allowed parts of President Donald Trump's travel ban to go into effect and will hear oral arguments on the case this fall.\nThis is the first time the high court has weighed in on the travel ban, and a partial victory for the Trump administration, which has been fighting lower court rulings blocking the ban from taking effect.\n\"I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive.\"\nHow officials implement the ban could cause chaos at airports, similar to what happened when Trump's first travel ban executive order was written in January (it was later blocked).\n\u2014 Donald J.

Robart's temporary restraining order Friday that suspended enforcement of the most controversial provisions of the ban across the country. \"The injunction immediately harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the President, based on his national security judgment,\" lawyers wrote in their motion. \"The injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the nation\u2019s elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and second-guesses the President\u2019s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk,\" it said. The motion follows an earlier filing by the government giving notice of its intention to appeal the Seattle judge's order. In a brief on behalf of the administration, acting Solicitor Gen. Noel Francisco said Robart's order, issued in response to a suit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota, was an \"impermissible intrusion\" into Trump's authority and amounted to \"second-guessing\" the president. The Trump administration has said a suspension of travel to the U.S. by citizens of countries with connections to terrorism is needed until the government can develop a system of \"extreme vetting\" to screen incoming visitors. It imposes a temporary ban on new arrivals from seven predominantly Muslim countries--Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Iran and Somalia--and suspends resettlement of refugees in the U.S. Many travelers from those countries began arriving at airports Saturday after Robart issued the restraining order that set aside the ban pending further legal arguments.

He signed a scaled-back version of the previous executive order, which was halted by the courts, that does more to guard against the idea that it is a thinly veiled \"Muslim ban\" and excludes Iraq from the list of banned countries. Whether the new ban passes legal muster is one question - and it will undoubtedly be answered in pretty short order. But as much as anything, the handling of the new executive order makes some of Trump's actions and claims surrounding the first ban appear particularly haphazard and disingenuous. Trump and his aides said many things about the need for the last executive order that simply don't hold up anymore. Below, we review a few of them. 1) CLAIM: The travel ban simply could not wait. REALITY: The revised ban was originally due almost two weeks ago -- and was reportedly delayed for political reasons. When Trump signed the first executive order one week into his presidency - and implementation over that first weekend went poorly, even according to many Republicans - the White House justified it by saying that it was an urgent need and couldn't wait. Trump signed the new executive order barring new visas for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and shutting down the U.S. refugee program in private. http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR Trump signed the new executive order barring new visas for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and shutting down the U.S. refugee program in private. http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR SEE MORE VIDEOS But it has been almost a month since the last one was halted. And as The Post's Callum Borchers wrote last week, both Politico and CNN reported that this new order was delayed for political purposes: Asked in a Jan. 30 interview on MSNBC why Trump had moved so quickly to sign the order, press secretary Sean Spicer said \"there was a very short period of time in which we had something to execute that ensured that the people of the United States were safe.\" Spicer clarified that U.S. intelligence agencies had not detected a specific threat but said: \"Do you wait until you do? The answer is you act now to protect the future.\" The new answer seems to be that the White House will act when the media moment is right. Trump had planned to unveil a revised order on Wednesday but held off amid a wave of largely positive coverage of his address to Congress Tuesday night. Politico, citing unnamed administration officials, reported that the president didn't want to divide the media's attention. . . . In a similar report, CNN quoted an unnamed official who said the White House wanted the new order \"to have its own moment.\" 2) CLAIM: You can't give notice of the ban's implementation date. REALITY: The new ban gives a 10-day notice. Here's what Trump said after the first ban's rough implementation weekend, amid questions of why it couldn't have been delayed by a few days while agencies figured out how to deal with it: Trump tweeted: If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! Apparently that prospect no longer applies. The new travel ban has a 10-day period before it will take effect on March 16. So those \"bad\" \"dudes\" have not only had a month to enter the country since the last ban was struck down, but they'll now have 10 more days to game the system knowing exactly what's coming. (Unless Trump's claim was all bluster.) 3) CLAIM: The White House would appeal the initial ruling and wouldn't rescind the first travel ban. REALITY: The White House is rescinding the first travel ban. Trump said after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the temporary restraining order on his first ban, \"SEE YOU IN COURT.\" Trump tweeted: SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! White House press secretary Sean Spicer, meanwhile, told reporters Feb. 21 that the initial travel ban wouldn't be rescinded when the replacement was signed. QUESTION: One more clarification just before you go. So, when the new EO comes out, you won't rescind the original one, you'll leave it in place? SPICER: That's correct. Both were wrong. That appeal still hadn't come as of Monday, and the new executive order rescinds the first travel ban effective on the date that the new one will be implemented: March 16. 4) CLAIM: The first ban's implementation process was silky smooth. REALITY: The administration says the new implementation process won't be so rocky this time. When the media reported on the chaos as airports the first weekend that the travel ban was in effect, the White House dismissed these reports completely (even as Republicans complained). The Post reported: Their overarching message: Everything is going exactly according to plan, nothing has changed since the order was signed, and the news media need to calm down their \"false, misleading, inaccurate, hyperventilating\" coverage of the \"fractional, marginal, minuscule percentage\" of international travelers who have been simply \"set aside for further questioning\" for a couple hours on their way into the greatest country in the world. \"It really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level,\" the administration official said at one point. In describing the new executive order, though, a Department of Homeland Security official acknowledged the chaotic rollout and said it would be avoided. (The official did qualify this statement with \"alleged chaos.\") \"You should not see any chaos, so to speak, or alleged chaos, at airports. There aren't going to be folks stopped tonight from coming into the country because of this executive order. If they are, it's pursuant to our ordinary screening procedures,\" the anonymous DHS official said. \"We're going to have a very smooth implementation period.\"", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": ["aaron blake"], "type": "article", "id": 344, "author_string": "aaron blake"}, {"title": "What happens if Trump decides to ignore a judge's ruling?", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-donald-trump-travel-ban-analysis-20170205-story.html", "text": "President Donald Trump has spent the better part of the last 24 hours bashing a Washington state judge's decision to temporarily halt his travel ban executive order. First came a White House statement calling the ruling \"outrageous\" (the word was later taken out). Then came Trump's many tweets, which were scattered throughout the day Saturday and actually seemed to question the judge's authority. And then, in its appeal, the Trump administration said the lower-court judge shouldn't be \"second-guessing\" the president. The administration is complying with the order. But Trump's tweets and this type of rhetoric about the judge's authority begs the question: What if it didn't? What if Trump -- or any president -- decided too much was at stake or that he didn't recognize (in his words) \"this so-called judge's\" authority? It's something experts on executive authority have been chewing over. Given Trump's populist campaign, admiration for authoritarian leaders and expressed skepticism toward the political establishment, some think it's it's possible he takes on the judicial establishment, too. \"They're spoiling for a fight, and that's what populists do,\" said Daniel P. Franklin, a professor at Georgia State University. \"And I think that's the way it plays out -- maybe not on this issue, but on something.\" I'll emphasize upfront that the Trump administration has given no indication that they'll actually ignore this particular court order -- or any other. (They're appealing, and the 9th Circuit declined to immediately reinstate the ban early Sunday morning.) And doing so would take things further than most any president ever has; Franklin said he's not aware of when a president \"purposely ignored a direct court order.\" But sometimes presidents have interpreted court decisions in ways that lead to discord between branches of government, leading to the threat of constitutional crises. The most oft-cited example of a president allegedly ignoring a court ruling just happens to involve the populist president that Trump's team seems most interested in comparing to Trump: Andrew Jackson. After the Supreme Court and Justice John Marshall struck down a Georgia law that allowed for the seizure of Native American lands, saying it violated federal treaties, Jackson ignored it or at least initially declined to get involved -- depending upon the account. He is remembered to have said, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it,\" though there is debate about the accuracy of that quote. According to Native American scholar Frank Pommersheim: \"While others consider the statement apocryphal, there is no doubt that President Jackson supported Georgia's claimed sovereignty over Cherokee land. The constitutional imbroglio was only averted when the impending nullification crisis convinced President Jackson that such a constitutional crisis was not in the national interest.\" An earlier and plainer example also involved Marshall -- and a Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson. Jeffrey Rosen wrote for PBS that a showdown between the two pitted Jefferson's federalist views against Marshall's view that the Supreme Court had authority over all U.S. laws: \"The culmination of Marshall's national vision came in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), in which he wrote an opinion for a unanimous Court upholding Congress' power to charter the Bank of the United States. Marshall resurrected the same arguments that Alexander Hamilton had used to persuade George Washington to charter the bank over Jefferson's objections: namely, that the Constitution gives Congress the authority to pass all laws 'necessary and proper' for executing its constitutional powers, and that those words should be construed broadly, in a practical spirit. \u2026 Although the decision was popular in the middle and Northern states, it precipitated a backlash against the Court in the Southern and Western states. \"Jefferson's reaction to McCulloch was especially peevish and extreme. He endorsed attacks on the decision published by the radical states' rights partisans Spencer Roane and John Taylor, agreeing that the Supreme Court had no power to review the constitutionality of state laws or to second-guess the decisions of state courts. Later, he seemed to deny entirely the Supreme Court's power to hand down binding interpretations of the Constitution. This proved too radical for Jefferson's protege, James Madison, who wrote to his patron that he had no doubt that the framers of the Constitution intended the federal courts to be a final arbiter of conflicts between federal and state law. On his deathbed, just before he expired on July 4, 1826, Jefferson criticized Madison for being too accommodating.\" Another potential parallel involves Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War. From history.com: \"John Merryman, a state legislator from Maryland, is arrested for attempting to hinder Union troops from moving from Baltimore to Washington during the Civil War and is held at Fort McHenry by Union military officials. His attorney immediately sought a writ of habeas corpus so that a federal court could examine the charges. However, President Abraham Lincoln decided to suspend the right of habeas corpus, and the general in command of Fort McHenry refused to turn Merryman over to the authorities. \"Federal judge Roger Taney, the chief justice of the Supreme Court (and also the author of the infamous Dred Scott decision), issued a ruling that President Lincoln did not have the authority to suspend habeas corpus. Lincoln didn't respond, appeal, or order the release of Merryman. But during a July 4 speech, Lincoln was defiant, insisting that he needed to suspend the rules in order to put down the rebellion in the South. \"Five years later, a new Supreme Court essentially backed Justice Taney's ruling: In an unrelated case, the court held that only Congress could suspend habeas corpus and that civilians were not subject to military courts, even in times of war.\" If Trump were to ever go down this road, Franklin said, the ultimate arbiter would be the other, third, branch of government. He said Trump could be held in contempt of court, and it would then be up to the House of Representatives. \"(Contempt of court), in my opinion, is a 'high crime or misdemeanor' in the meaning of the Constitution, and he would be subject to impeachment,\" Franklin said. \"Whether or not the House of Representatives would see it that way is another question. It is at that point their call.\"", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-02-05", "authors": ["aaron blake"], "type": "article", "id": 322, "author_string": "aaron blake"}, {"title": "Trump defends himself on Twitter against accusations he colluded with Russia to win the election", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-defends-himself-on-twitter-1490012227-htmlstory.html", "text": "As the House Intelligence Committee prepares for its first public hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 election, President Trump took to Twitter to defend himself against suggestions that he or people close to him had colluded with Moscow.

Earlier in this month, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he could deny that he'd seen any evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. \"James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia,\" Trump wrote Monday, referring himself by an acronym for President of the United States. \"This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!\" A few minutes later, Trump wrote another tweet, saying: \"The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign.\" But several of Trump's campaign staff and close associates had contacts with Russian officials. Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn, for example, had direct contacts with Russia's ambassador in Washington and was paid tens of thousands of dollars by a state-owned Russian television channel.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-03-31", "authors": ["brian bennett"], "type": "article", "id": 461, "author_string": "brian bennett"}, {"title": "Schiff says Nunes can't lead Russia inquiry and be a Trump surrogate", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-essential-washington-updates-schiff-nunes-can-t-lead-russia-probe-1490218818-htmlstory.html", "text": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Tulare) has risked undermining the credibility of the panel's investigation of Russian interference of the 2016 election by sharing new information with the White House, his Democratic counterpart said Wednesday.

Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) told reporters. \"The chairman will either need to decide if he's leading an investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House. Because he cannot do both,\" Schiff said at a Capitol Hill news conference. The assessment, even if delivered in Schiff's typically understated fashion, reflected a potential breakdown in what is traditionally a nonpartisan partnership between the top Republican and Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. It was all the more striking given that both men have served together for more than a decade in the same state congressional delegation. Schiff said he raised his concerns directly with Nunes after the Republican disclosed new information publicly and then to the White House. He stopped short of saying whether Nunes was improperly making classified information public, saying instead that his actions were \"beyond irregular.\" Nunes' actions further demonstrated the need for an independent inquiry into Russia's actions during the campaign, Schiff said. \"We're the only investigation there is. If we don't do it, no one is going to do it,\" Schiff said. \"Now, perhaps the White House would like it that way. But the American people, I think, want there to be a credible investigation.

WASHINGTON \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly predicted Tuesday that the Trump administration will prevail in its bid to reinstate an executive order temporarily barring refugees as well as people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States and mused that judges might be considering the matter from an \u2018\u2018academic,\u2019\u2019 rather than a national security, perspective. \u2018\u2018Of course, in their courtrooms, they\u2019re protected by people like me,\u2019\u2019 he said.

That stands somewhat in contrast to Trump\u2019s recent assertion to Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly that the implementation was \u2018\u2018very smooth.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018In retrospect, I should have \u2014 this is all on me, by the way \u2014 I should have delayed it just a bit, so that I could talk to members of Congress, particularly the leadership of committees like this, to prepare them for what was coming, although I think most people would agree that this has been a topic of President Trump certainly during his campaign and during the transition process,\u2019\u2019 Kelly said. Kelly later said, though, that most of the confusion is attributable to court orders and occurred not among Customs and Border Protection officers, but protesters in airports. Kelly\u2019s comments came as a federal appeals court panel was preparing to hear oral arguments on whether Trump\u2019s ban should be reinstated. The hearing marks a critical juncture for the president\u2019s directive, which a lower federal court judge in Washington had ordered suspended last week. Advertisement Kelly said that he was not criticizing any judge but that their considerations were \u2018\u2018academic\u2019\u2019 and possibly in a \u2018\u2018vacuum.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018I have nothing but respect for our judges, but they live in a different world than I do,\u2019\u2019 he said. Kelly also cast the Trump directive as a mere \u2018\u2018pause\u2019\u2019 that would allow US officials to assess vetting procedures, and he said they were not contemplating expanding it beyond the seven affected countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The opposition to the measure is mounting. On Monday, 10 former high-ranking diplomatic and national security officials; nearly 100 Silicon Valley tech companies; more than 280 law professors; a coalition of 16 state or district attorneys general; and a host of civil liberties and other organizations formally lent their support to the legal bid to block Trump\u2019s travel ban. The high-ranking diplomatic and security officials \u2014 among them former secretaries of state John F. Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former CIA director Leon Panetta, former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael V. Hayden \u2014 said there was \u2018\u2018no national security purpose\u2019\u2019 for a complete barring of people from the seven affected countries. Advertisement \u2018\u2018Since September 11, 2001, not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order,\u2019\u2019 the group said. \u2018\u2018Very few attacks on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001, have been traced to foreign nationals at all.\u2019\u2019 The appeals court panel will have to consider whether Trump exceeded his authority and violated the First Amendment and federal immigration law, and whether his order imposes irreparable harm on those it affects. The three judges hearing the matter are William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Carter; Judge Richard Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland, who was appointed by President Obama. The states of Washington and Minnesota argued in a filing Monday that reinstating the ban would \u2018\u2018unleash chaos again\u2019\u2019 by \u2018\u2018separating families, stranding our university students and faculty, and barring travel.\u2019\u2019 Justice Department lawyers countered that noncitizens outside the United States have \u2018\u2018no substantive right or basis for judicial review in the denial of a visa at all,\u2019\u2019 and that, at most, the lower court judge should have limited his ruling to \u2018\u2018previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\u2019\u2019 After the appeals court rules, either side can ask the Supreme Court to intervene.

Top immigration officials, led by newly sworn-in Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, moved to allay the havoc that marked the rollout of the bans over the weekend. They visited Capitol Hill to reach out to Republican lawmakers upset over being excluded while the order was being developed and separately briefed reporters on adjustments to the program. They also acknowledged that the disruption was more widespread than previously known, saying 721 travelers were denied boarding on flights to the U.S. But some 872 refugees were exempted from the ban because of undue hardships and will be arriving in the U.S. this week, said Kevin McAleenan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. \u201cThe vast majority of the 1.7 billion Muslims that live on this planet, the vast majority of them have, all other things being equal, have access to the United States,\u201d Kelly told reporters. \u201cAnd a relatively small number right now are being held up for a period of time until we can take a look at what their procedures are.\u201d Kelly pressed forward with Trump\u2019s plans to transform U.S. border policy, saying for the first time that some of the restrictions that caused confusion and sparked protests over the weekend could be extended well into the future.

Trump ordered all travelers from those nations prohibited from entering the U.S. for 90 days; in addition, refugees from Syria are blocked indefinitely and those from any other country are barred for 120 days. The list of banned countries may expand; Trump\u2019s order directed Kelly to submit within 60 days a list of additional nations whose citizens should be prohibited from traveling to the U.S. as well. The moves signaled that the White House remained committed to remaking border law enforcement while trying to combat the widespread condemnation brought on by Trump\u2019s orders. White House officials were under fire for not giving clear instructions to border officials, which sowed confusion at airports across the country. Senior Trump aides decided to circulate the draft of the order only among a small, tightly controlled group of experts and Cabinet secretaries. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that runs hundreds of immigration checkpoints at the country\u2019s airports and ports of entry, did not prepare instructions for border officials in advance of the order being signed Friday evening. Changes to who would be allowed in the country were made on the spot over the weekend, as were new procedures for awarding waivers from the travel bans while travelers were detained inside airports. \u201cThe notion that the operators who have to implement this across hundreds of ports of entry would first see this order at 5 p.m. on a Friday is shocking,\u201d said John Sandweg, a former senior immigration official under President Obama. \u201cIt looks to me like they have only now become aware of the impacts of the policy the drafters didn\u2019t foresee or the White House didn\u2019t foresee,\u201d he said. \"The rollout of this executive order was terrible,\" said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and a Trump supporter, blaming the president\u2019s staff for not doing more to predict potential problems. GOP senators, who were inundated with requests from constituents for assistance, aired their complaints to Vice President Mike Pence, a guest at their weekly lunch at the Capitol on Tuesday. White House officials understood that they risk their relationships with Republican lawmakers over how the order was executed, said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t know yet is whether it\u2019s a concern or not on their end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be the way they want to roll right now.\u201d When asked whether the executive order is legal, Corker responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Kelly, McAleenan and other top Homeland Security officials conceded some problems as implementation began, including poor communication. But they maintained that all court orders were followed, rebutted reports that some legal residents were denied access to attorneys at airports and said everyone detained by border agents was treated with \"dignity and respect.\" The White House, which has contended that the president\u2019s order was not aimed at Muslims despite Trump promising such a move during his campaign, even backed off from the term \u201cban,\u201d as did Kelly.

But they insisted that all court orders were followed over the weekend, rebutted reports that some legal residents were denied access to attorneys at airports and said they everyone detained by border agents was treated with \"dignity and respect.\" \u201cThe vast majority of the 1.7 billion Muslims that live on this planet, the vast majority of them have, all other things being equal, have access to the United States,\u201d Kelly told reporters. \u201cAnd a relatively small number right now are being held up for a period of time until we can take a look at what their procedures are,\u201d he said, seeming to acknowledge that mostly Muslims have been affected by the ban. The moves signaled that the White House remained committed to remaking border law enforcement even in the face of widespread confusion and condemnation of President Trump\u2019s order. Kelly said for the first time that the some of the restrictions that caused confusion and sparked protests over the weekend could be extended well into the future. \"Some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon,\" he said.

Shortly after he was elected, he undermined longstanding U.S. policy toward China by speaking directly with Taiwan's leader before his inauguration, thrusting into doubt the U.S. commitment to the so-called \"one China\" policy. Japan has concerns about China's rising influence in the Pacific and Beijing's military buildup in the South China Sea. The U.S. has about 50,000 troops stationed in Japan, and Abe is expected to seek assurances from Trump that the U.S. will stand up for Japan's presence on the Senkaku Islands, territory that China disputes. Trump's comments about increasing the U.S. nuclear arms stockpile has also unnerved Asian leaders concerned about a new arms race. Japan has long viewed with worry North Korea's attempts to build a nuclear weapon that could reach its shores.

In addition, refugees from any country are barred for four months.

(Stephen Carr / AP) People with close ties get into U.S. But what\u2019s a close tie? When it allowed a limited version of the travel ban to proceed, Supreme Court justices said the government could not apply it to people who had well-established connections to the U.S. The court listed employment, university admission and invitations to lecture \u2014 such as at a college \u2014 among those connections. On Thursday, the departments of State and Homeland Security said people with green cards and visas that were valid before the ban went into effect won\u2019t be affected. The same goes for people granted asylum, and those who could claim dual nationality with another country not on the travel ban list. Diplomats, visitors to the United Nations, NATO officials and certain foreign government representatives are also among the exceptions. Several of those categories were added to Trump\u2019s second executive order on travel that was signed in March after the first one saw court setbacks. A point of contention remains: How to define who has well-established ties to the U.S. The administration is now facing criticism from immigrant advocates for its list, released late Thursday, detailing what kinds of family members are \u201cclose\u201d enough to escape the travel ban. Spouses, parents, in-laws and siblings are considered close; grandparents and other relations are not. Initially, fiances were subject to the ban.

The Department of State has said refugees who arrive in the country through July 6 will be admitted whether they can claim a connection to the U.S. or not. That\u2019s the date that the department expects a 50,000 cap on refugees to be reached for the fiscal year, which ends Oct. 1. The cap is listed in Trump\u2019s executive order on the ban. As of Wednesday night, the department said 49,009 refugees had come to the country this fiscal year. Officials said they would give instructions later on what to do with refugees planning to arrive after July 6. The Supreme Court\u2019s order said the cap can be exceeded for refugees who claim a legitimate U.S. relationship. How many people does this affect? Lawyers who have sued the president said the travel ban, as it currently stands, will block significantly fewer people than previous attempts at a ban. \u201cMost non-citizens who come to this country and are applying for a visa have a connection to the U.S.,\u201d said Justin Cox, an attorney at the National Immigration Law Center who is part of a team representing refugee and immigrant groups fighting the ban in the Supreme Court. \u201cOn the other hand, there are more than 200 million people in the world who couldn\u2019t get in because these six countries have a population of about 180 million and there are about 65 million refugees,\u201d he said. Cox said the government had too narrowly applied the court\u2019s instructions on who should be exempted from the travel restrictions. He said government was \u201cessentially shutting down\u201d refugee resettlement. But Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, said the Trump administration was on solid ground. \u201cI probably would have also included grandparents, for no other reason than they tug at sentimental heart strings. But when administering the immigration laws, the government often draws lines that are harsh and arbitrary,\u201d he said. Government officials said they have no estimate of how many people the travel ban will block. The six nations represent a sliver of international travel to the country. The U.S. has no embassy or limited consular services in many of them. Data from 2015 show that there were 49,412 tourist and business visits to the U.S. by citizens of the six countries. Employment and student visas that year accounted for 13,000 visits. Green cards, which make someone a legal permanent resident, were given that year to 31,258 people from the nations. Not all those people would be new immigrants. Some people secure green cards after living in the U.S. a long time. According to Betsy Fisher, policy director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, there are about 26,000 refugees who have \u201cgone through extensive vetting\u201d and are approved by the U.S. government for relocation. The vast majority of those do not have tickets booked to travel before the July 6 deadline. A large portion have no family ties in the U.S. Support our journalism Already a subscriber?

That part of the court\u2019s ruling was a victory for President Donald Trump, who rolled out a first ban on travelers and refugees after just a week in office, prompting a legal fight that has raged ever since. But the Supreme Court also denied the administration\u2019s request to clarify its ruling last month that allowed the administration to partially reinstate a 90-day ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on refugees from anywhere in the world. The court\u2019s ruling exempted a large swath of refugees and travelers with a \u2018\u2018bona fide relationship\u2019\u2019 with a person or an entity in the U.S. The justices did not define those relationships but said they could include a close relative, a job offer or admission to a college or university.

U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled Thursday that the government had failed to follow Supreme Court orders last month that established conditions for a partial revival of the ban, whose implementation had been blocked by the courts. The decision does not halt the travel ban, which was reinstated by the Supreme Court on June 29 with exemptions for a limited list people with \u201cbona fide\u201d U.S. connections, such as close family members. But going against Trump administration policy, the ruling expands the exceptions to include travelers who have grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law in the U.S. The judge also said that contrary to government policy, refugees cannot be blocked if they have \u201cformal assurance\u201d from U.S. resettlement agencies for relocation to the country \u2014 even if the refugees do not have relatives in the U.S. The administration\u2019s implementation of the ban\u2019s limits represented \u201cthe antithesis of common sense,\u201d the judge said. In a statement Friday, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions accused Watson of trying to \u201cmicromanage\u201d the president\u2019s authority over ensuring national security. \u201cBy this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court,\u201d Sessions said. In the meantime, unless a higher court intervenes, Watson\u2019s decision means that potentially thousands of refugees who had been vetted for U.S. admission but were blocked after the government cut off most refugee admissions on Wednesday \u2014 the day the country hit a cap of 50,000 refugee admissions for the fiscal year \u2014 may now be let in. \u201cWe are reviewing the decision and will be in consultation with DOJ to ensure immediate implementation,\u201d the Department of State said in a statement Friday. The Department of Justice also said in a court filing Friday that it was challenging Watson\u2019s order in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Refugee resettlement groups and immigrant advocates on Friday celebrated Watson\u2019s decision. The order \u201crepresents relief for over 24,000 refugees who had already been vetted and approved by the U.S. and assigned to resettlement agencies. Many of them had already sold all of their belongings to start their new lives in safety,\u201d Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in a statement. The group is among those suing the administration over the ban. \u201cThis decision gives back hope to so many who would otherwise be stranded indefinitely,\u201d Heller said. \u201cNevertheless, we will continue to fight for our refugee clients, who are still affected by the government\u2019s attempts to freeze refugee resettlement.\u201d For two weeks, the Trump administration and the state of Hawaii have fought repeatedly in federal courts over whom the ban can block. At issue is how to determine which travelers have \u201cclose\u201d relatives living in the U.S. or are associated with the country in other ways that let them bypass the ban \u2014 standards set by the Supreme Court when it lifted the previous halt on enforcement of the ban. President Trump\u2019s executive order halts travel by nationals of Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Iran but allows exceptions for those with what the Supreme Court called \u201cbona fide\u201d connections with the U.S. The government has said those connections include a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, fiance or fiancee, and in-law parents. But the administration said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law are not close enough to qualify for admission during the duration of the order. Attorneys for the state of Hawaii successfully petitioned Watson to order the government to count all of those categories as \u201cbona fide\u201d U.S. connections. In the case of refugees, state lawyers argued that a refugee resettlement organization\u2019s interactions with a refugee constitute a bona fide relationship. The administration disagreed. Hawaii's win came after it was twice rejected in court attempts to weaken the ban. On July 6, Watson denied a request from the state to \"clarify\" exceptions to the ban, saying that he did not have the authority to interpret Supreme Court orders. The next day, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a similar request from the state, saying it did not have jurisdiction over the matter. But appellate judges told challengers that they could try a different legal maneuver in the district court. Judges said Hawaii attorneys could request Watson to issue an injunction against the ban's implementation or modify an injunction he had issued that previously had halted the ban before his order was partially lifted by the Supreme Court. Hawaii filed both requests last week. The travel ban calls for a three-month pause on travel to the U.S. by nationals of the six Muslim-majority countries and a four-month halt on all refugee resettlement. Watson was one of the judges who granted a restraining order blocking implementation. His order was issued in a case filed in March by the state of Hawaii. Successful challenges in that case and another filed in a Maryland federal court were upheld in the 9th Circuit and 4th Circuit appellate courts before requests were made to the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ban. On June 26, the Supreme Court said the ban could be put back into place with exceptions, but left it up to the government to define most of them. The court indicated its move was a temporary measure until justices hear full arguments on Trump\u2019s executive order in the fall.

The government\u2019s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\u201d The next day, Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized the ruling as undermining national security, creating confusion and violating respect for separation of powers. \u201cThe district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in a statement. Later that day, the administration filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to clarify its decision. It said the justices should act immediately, without waiting for a ruling from the appeals court. The administration said it was entitled to exclude refugees whom resettlement agencies had planned to help move to the United States. Judge Watson disagreed, writing that the Supreme Court had meant to allow such people to enter the country. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAn assurance from a United States refugee resettlement agency, in fact, meets each of the Supreme Court\u2019s touchstones,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is formal, it is a documented contract, it is binding, it triggers responsibilities and obligations, including compensation, it is issued specific to an individual refugee only when that refugee has been approved for entry by the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d In its Supreme Court brief, the Justice Department said that Judge Watson\u2019s ruling \u201cwould render the refugee portion of this court\u2019s decision effectively meaningless.\u201d Lawyers for Hawaii who are challenging the travel ban disputed that assertion. They said about 24,000 refugees had a formal assurance of help from a settlement agency, while another 175,000 in the pipeline did not. \u201cMany of those refugees \u2014 as well as countless visa applicants from the targeted nations \u2014 will be unable to demonstrate any other form of bona fide relationship with an American party, meaning that they will be absolutely barred from entering the country in the next several months,\u201d the Hawaii lawyers wrote. They also said Judge Watson\u2019s order did nothing to stop the administration from enforcing its travel ban against an estimated 85 percent of refugees, or to exclude extended family members \u201cwho indisputably lack close relationships with American individuals and entities.\u201d On Wednesday, the Supreme Court rejected the administration\u2019s request for clarity on the scope of last month\u2019s decision. The justices said that the appeal in the case should follow the ordinary course and that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, should first address the question. In temporarily blocking the part of Judge Watson\u2019s order concerning refugees, the Supreme Court indicated that the government\u2019s arguments had weight. In declining to disturb the part of the order that allowed relatives to enter, the Supreme Court suggested that the administration might have overreached. Challenges to Mr. Trump\u2019s travel bans have been ricocheting around the federal courts for almost as long as he has been president. His first ban, issued in January, caused chaos at the nation\u2019s airports until it was blocked by the courts. Rather than appealing to the Supreme Court, the administration issued a revised executive order in March. But that order, too, was blocked by federal appeals courts, which ruled that it violated the Constitution by discriminating based on religion and that it exceeded Mr. Trump\u2019s authority.

Chuang in federal court in Maryland marks another win for challengers of the president\u2019s executive order, which had been slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. Earlier, a different federal judge in Hawaii stopped it. Chuang\u2019s order did not sweep as broadly as the one in Hawaii, but he similarly declared that even the revised travel ban was intended to discriminate against Muslims.

The Justice Department had said that it strongly disagreed with the ruling in the Hawaii case, and that the executive order Trump issued \u2018\u2018falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation\u2019s security.\u2019\u2019 The government\u2019s next legal step is unclear. At a rally in Nashville on Wednesday, Trump said he was prepared to take the case to the Supreme Court. He also mused a return to his original executive order, which imposed a more sweeping ban than the second. Advertisement \u2018\u2018Let me tell you something. I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way,\u2019\u2019 Trump said. \u2018\u2018The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.\u2019\u2019 The first order temporarily barred entry for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and suspended the U.S. refugee program. When it was implemented, the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas, and some travelers affected while in transit were detained and deported from U.S. airports. Officials had hoped the revised version would be more defensible in court. It reduced the list of countries affected to six - removing Iraq, while keeping Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria. It also applied only to those seeking new visas, and spelled out a robust list of those who might be exempted. The new order maintained the suspension of the refugee program. On Wednesday, with the order set to go into effect in just hours, federal judges in three separate states heard urgent challenges to the measure. The case in Maryland was brought by three organization and six people, claiming the order affected their work or prevented their family members from the affected countries from getting visas to enter the U.S. Chuang blocked only the provision of the new order affecting the issuance of visas to those from the six affected countries. He said those suing had \u2018\u2018not provided a sufficient basis\u2019\u2019 for him to declare the other sections invalid. Advertisement In Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson had gone further, also suspending the portion of the order that affected refugees. His ruling will be undisturbed by Chuang\u2019s, and appeals courts would ultimately have to decide to what extent each of them was right. Justice Department lawyers had argued the ban was necessary for national security. As evidence to support their claim, they pointed to a request from the U.S. attorney general and homeland security secretary - penned March 6, after the first ban had been frozen - asking for the measure. They also pointed to more than 300 people who they said entered the U.S. as refugees and were the subjects of counterterrorism investigations Chuang wrote that he \u2018\u2018should not, and will not, second-guess the conclusion that national security interests would be served by the travel ban,\u2019\u2019 but if the national security rationale was secondary to an attempt to disfavor a particular religion, he had no choice but to block the executive order. \u2018\u2018In this highly unique case,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u2018\u2018the record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban.\u2019\u2019 The same federal district court judge in Washington who blocked Trump\u2019s first travel ban is also considering challenges to the new one.", "top_words": ["executive", "blocks", "travel", "case", "hawaii", "revised", "trump", "second", "ban", "affected", "security", "judge", "federal", "order"], "summary": "A second federal judge issued a restraining order Thursday blocking enforcement of one of the critical sections of President Donald Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, using Trump\u2019s own comments against him in deciding the ban was likely to run afoul of the Constitution.\nEarlier, a different federal judge in Hawaii stopped it.\nChuang\u2019s order did not sweep as broadly as the one in Hawaii, but he similarly declared that even the revised travel ban was intended to discriminate against Muslims.\nHe also mused a return to his original executive order, which imposed a more sweeping ban than the second.\nAdvertisementIn Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick K.

Advertisement The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Virginia last month cited the president\u2019s campaign statements calling for a \u2018\u2018total and complete shutdown\u2019\u2019 on Muslims entering the United States as evidence that the 90-day ban was unconstitutionally \u2018\u2018steeped in animus and directed at a single religious group,\u2019\u2019 rather than necessary for national security.

Lawyers for Hawaii told the high court Monday that letting the administration enforce the ban while the case is being decided by the justices would \u2018\u2018thrust the country back into the chaos and confusion\u2019\u2019 that resulted when the policy was first announced in January. The state urged the justices to deny an administration plea to reinstate the policy. They could act on the administration\u2019s request before the session ends at the end of June. Monday\u2019s ruling by the Ninth Circuit was both logistically and symbolically important \u2014 keeping in place the broadest blockade on Trump\u2019s ban and creating new legal and practical paths for the directive to meet its ultimate demise. Advertisement Unlike other courts, the three judges on the Ninth Circuit did not dwell on Trump\u2019s public comments, nor did they declare the president had run afoul of the constitution because his intent was to discriminate. Instead, they ruled that Trump\u2019s travel ban lacked a sufficient national security or other justification that would make it legal, and that violated immigration law. They offered no opinion on whether the ban was constitutional. \u2018\u2018There is no finding that present vetting standards are inadequate, and no finding that absent the improved vetting procedures there likely will be harm to our national interests,\u2019\u2019 the judges wrote. \u2018\u2018These identified reasons do not support the conclusion that the entry of nationals from the six designated countries would be harmful to our national interests.\u2019\u2019 A Justice Department spokesman said officials were preparing a response. Advertisement Neal Katyal, one of the lawyers representing those challenging the ban, said on Twitter that the decision was a \u2018\u2018complete win\u2019\u2019 and noted it was different than previous victories in other cases. While the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had upheld a separate freeze on Trump\u2019s ban, that freeze did not apply to the portion of Trump\u2019s order dealing with refugees. The Ninth Circuit was considering a freeze that did, and concluded Trump had not provided sufficient justification to either temporarily suspend refugee admission or lower the refugee cap for fiscal 2017 to 50,000. The opinion also clarified that the administration could conduct an internal review to assess vetting procedures. That could be construed as a victory for Trump: The appeals court said a federal judge in Hawaii was wrong to restrict his administration from conducting such a review. But it also forces the Supreme Court to act quickly if the travel ban is to be salvaged. That is because the measure is supposed to be temporary \u2014 barring the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim majority countries for 90 days and suspending the US refugee program for 120 days so officials could review vetting procedures. The Justice Department had argued that it felt blocked from conducting such a review by the Hawaii judge, meaning the clock had essentially stopped. Trump seemed to suggest on Twitter recently that he did not view the measure as a temporary one. \u2018\u2018People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban!\u2019\u2019 he wrote. Trump\u2019s own press secretary had previously disputed calling the measure a ban, and the Justice Department has sought in court to characterize it as a \u2018\u2018temporary pause.\u2019\u2019 The Ninth Circuit opinion was written by judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould, and Richard Paez, all appointed by Bill Clinton. The judges heard arguments in the case last month and focused much of their questioning on Trump\u2019s public comments, which other judges have cited as evidence the president meant to discriminate against Muslims in imposing a ban. Trump earlier this month doubled down on some of those comments, deriding the revised travel ban as a \u2018\u2018watered down\u2019\u2019 version of the first and calling the new measure \u2018\u2018politically correct.\u2019\u2019 Legal analysts said that might ultimately hurt his case. In their ruling, though, the Ninth Circuit judges criticized the Trump administration not for its public opining, but for its lack of a real justification for the directive. The judges noted that a Department of Homeland Security report concluded citizenship was an \u2018\u2018unreliable\u2019\u2019 threat indicator, and most foreign-born extremists are radicalized years after coming to the United States. The judges said the president had broad authority to set immigration policy, but it was \u2018\u2018not unlimited.\u2019\u2019", "top_words": ["ninth", "travel", "judges", "ban", "appeals", "circuit", "vetting", "blocking", "court", "trumps", "upholds", "administration", "decision"], "summary": "A three-judge panel with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against the administration unanimously.\nInstead, they ruled that Trump\u2019s travel ban lacked a sufficient national security or other justification that would make it legal, and that violated immigration law.\nWhile the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had upheld a separate freeze on Trump\u2019s ban, that freeze did not apply to the portion of Trump\u2019s order dealing with refugees.\nBut it also forces the Supreme Court to act quickly if the travel ban is to be salvaged.\n\u2018\u2018People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban!\u2019\u2019 he wrote.", "source": "bostonglobe", "publish_date": "2017-06-12", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "id": "25", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Trump\u2019s latest tweets could hurt effort to restore travel ban", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/06/05/trump-latest-tweets-could-hurt-effort-restore-travel-ban/0WzocSXj9mZiqr9OMtqpUM/story.html", "text": "President Trump said the Justice Department should seek a \u2018\u2018much tougher version\u2019\u2019 of the travel restrictions and made clear \u2014 despite his own press secretary\u2019s past remarks to the contrary \u2014 that the executive order is a \u2018\u2018ban,\u2019\u2019 not a pause on some sources of immigration or an enhanced vetting system.

Next week, those suing are expected to file arguments on the matter with the Supreme Court, and Trump\u2019s latest remarks will surely be a part of their briefs. The administration appealed to the nation\u2019s highest court after the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the freeze on the ban last month.

Advertisement Federal judges across the country have focused acutely on Trump\u2019s own comments in ordering the ban be frozen, determining that the president\u2019s words expose the measure as being a tool for discrimination disguised as a national security directive. The majority opinion in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit maintaining the freeze on the ban quoted extensively from Trump\u2019s tweets and media interviews, and from those of his advisers. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a \u2018\u2018total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u2019\u2019 Omar Jadwat, who argued the case in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, wrote that Trump\u2019s tweets amounted to \u2018\u2018a promise: let me do this and I\u2019ll take it as license to do even worse.\u2019\u2019 Government lawyers have sought to convince judges they should not consider the president\u2019s statements but instead limit their analysis to the text of the ban themselves. They have also sought to portray the president\u2019s words as campaign trail rhetoric, and noted that many of the remarks in question \u2014 though not all \u2014 came before Trump was elected. \u2018\u2018We shouldn\u2019t start down the road of psychoanalyzing what people meant on the campaign trail,\u2019\u2019 acting solicitor general Jeffrey Wall told judges at a recent court hearing in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Advertisement Trump\u2019s latest tweets will provide those challenging the ban more examples of post-election remarks and a stronger case that Trump\u2019s revised travel ban had the same purpose as the original version. That version, which unilaterally revoked visas from tens of thousands of people from seven Muslim majority countries, was seen as much harder to defend because it was much more onerous and had a provision in the text itself that seemed designed to exempt Christian travelers. Trump tweeted Monday that the Justice Department \u2018\u2018should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted\u2019\u2019 to the Supreme Court. In addition to creating possible headaches in court, that misstates the process. Trump himself signed the executive order imposing the ban. The Justice Department defends his policies in court. Trump also wrote that the Justice Department \u2018\u2018should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!\u2019\u2019 The Supreme Court would not be the body to enact a ban; they are merely weighing whether Trump\u2019s order can pass constitutional muster. The travel ban seems to have been on Trump\u2019s mind since the terrorist attack in London Saturday, when Trump wrote on Twitter, \u2018\u2018We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u2019\u2019 Legal analysts were quick to point out that the president was hurting his own case. \u2018\u2018In case it\u2019s not obvious, these will only undermine the government\u2019s case before #SCOTUS for both a stay & on the merits of the #TravelBan,\u2019\u2019 University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck posted on Twitter. \u2018\u2018These will also go a long way toward mooting debate over use of campaign statements; no need when, as President, he still says these things.\u2019\u2019 Trump also wrote on Twitter that the administration was already \u2018\u2018EXTREME VETTING\u2019\u2019 travelers coming into the United States \u2014 which he said was necessary to keep the country safe because courts are \u2018\u2018slow and political!\u2019\u2019 The Department of Homeland Security has previously suggested such vetting was taking place, but that, too, seems to undercut the Justice Department\u2019s legal position. The travel ban was supposed to be a temporary measure, designed to afford the administration time to conduct a review and decide what new vetting procedures were necessary. When a federal judge in Hawaii ordered the ban frozen, though, the government interpreted his order as stopping even that review \u2014 and the judge declined to clarify that it did not. Wall told the Fourth Circuit last month that the administration had \u2018\u2018put our pens down\u2019\u2019 and had \u2018\u2018done nothing to review the vetting procedures for these countries.\u2019\u2019 If the administration already has implemented new vetting procedures, that would seem to call into question the necessity of a temporary ban.

The stay applications present harder questions, and how the court answers them will have important practical consequences. The court typically moves quickly on requests for stays, often acting in about a week. Under its usual practices, it would not hear arguments on the applications and would issue brief orders announcing the outcome with little or no legal reasoning. If the court grants the requests, the travel ban will go back into effect and probably expire before the court hears arguments on the merits of the appeal. That could make the case moot.

It says the move is justified by the need to keep the nation safe, and it says presidents have almost unlimited discretion to make national security judgments and to control immigration. People and groups challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order say it was a product of religious intolerance and the culmination of his campaign pledges to institute a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d They say that violates the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of government establishment of religion, and several courts have agreed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In its brief urging the Supreme Court to hear its appeal, the Justice Department said the case was momentous. \u201cThis order has been the subject of passionate political debate,\u201d the brief said. \u201cBut whatever one\u2019s views, the precedent set by this case for the judiciary\u2019s proper role in reviewing the president\u2019s national security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this order, and this constitutional moment.\u201d Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said lower courts had been right to reject Mr. Trump\u2019s order. \u201cAgain and again, our nation\u2019s courts have found that President Trump\u2019s Muslim ban is unconstitutional,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to defend our plaintiffs\u2019 right to live free from fear of discriminatory treatment by the federal government.\u201d The case thus presents the Supreme Court with the opportunity to issue a major constitutional ruling on the scope of presidential power. But there are procedural wrinkles, and it is possible that the case will be resolved without a formal ruling. What have the trial courts done? Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii have blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, issued in March. The Maryland ruling was narrower, freezing only the order\u2019s 90-day suspension of entry from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The suspension was needed, the executive order said, to allow the government to conduct a review of its vetting procedures. The Hawaii ruling also blocked the order\u2019s suspension of the nation\u2019s refugee program. More important, it appeared to prohibit the government from completing its 90-day internal review process. That part of the Hawaii ruling may turn out to be very important. If it is lifted, the travel ban could expire before the Supreme Court has a chance to issue a definitive ruling. Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard, has urged the Supreme Court to focus on the Hawaii ruling. \u201cGrant the stay of the Hawaii injunction, thereby allowing the government to proceed with its internal review of screening procedures, deny the stay of the Fourth Circuit injunction, and do whatever the heck they want about the petition for certiorari,\u201d Professor Tushnet wrote on Balkinization, a law blog. \u201cThe case will then almost certainly be moot by the time it\u2019s argued.\u201d What happened in the appeals courts? Last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the decision by the judge in Maryland, refusing to revive the part of the ban limiting travel from the six countries.

On Friday, defending Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order in a Seattle courtroom, Michelle Bennett, a Justice Department lawyer, cited Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, a 1952 decision in which the Supreme Court rejected President Harry S. Truman\u2019s assertion that he had the authority to seize steel mills during the Korean War. The most famous part of the decision is a concurrence from Justice Robert H. Jackson, which set out a framework for considering clashes between presidential power and congressional authority. The president has the most power when he acts with congressional authorization, Justice Jackson said, and an intermediate amount when Congress is silent. The president\u2019s power is at its \u201clowest ebb,\u201d Justice Jackson wrote, when Congress has forbidden a particular action. Truman\u2019s actions fell into the third category, Justice Jackson wrote. Ms. Bennett, by contrast, said Mr. Trump\u2019s order was in the first category. \u201cHere we have the president acting pursuant to power that Congress gave him, which means, under the Youngstown steel seizure case, he\u2019s acting at the apex of his power,\u201d she said. A key part of immigration law does give the president broad power. It says, \u201cWhenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d But another part of the law forbids discrimination \u201cbecause of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence,\u201d but only \u201cin the issuance of an immigrant visa.\u201d The Trump administration argues that the power to bar entry, the subject of the first law, is broader than the limits on issuing visas. What about arguments based on religious discrimination? Lawyers for Washington State have said that the executive order violates the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition against government establishment of religion because its provisions on the refugee program favor minority religions. \u201cPresident Trump and his advisers have made clear that the very purpose of this order is to tilt the scales in favor of Christian refugees at the expense of Muslims,\u201d they wrote in their brief to Judge Robart. The Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president\u2019s motives, the brief said, would violate the separation of powers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe more searching inquiry envisioned by the states would create substantial separation-of-powers problems, by permitting probing of the president\u2019s subjective motive in issuing the order,\u201d the brief said. Could the case founder on the issue of injury? The states challenging the order face the initial hurdle of demonstrating that they have suffered the sort of direct and concrete harm that gives them standing to sue. Judge Robart ruled that they did, relying on a decision from the federal appeals court in New Orleans, which said Texas could sue to challenge President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to defer the deportation of millions of unauthorized immigrants and allow them to work. \u201cThe executive order adversely affects the states\u2019 residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,\u201d Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases. In its Ninth Circuit brief, the Trump administration called the states\u2019 asserted injuries \u201cattenuated and speculative\u201d and did not address the Texas decision.

Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter, asked Mr. Flentje a hypothetical question meant to probe the limits of his position. \u201cCould the president simply say in the order, \u2018We\u2019re not going to let any Muslims in?\u2019\u201d Mr. Flentje said the two states that have sued over Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, Washington and Minnesota, would be powerless to challenge that scenario. He said other plaintiffs might be able to sue on religious discrimination grounds. Noah G. Purcell, Washington State\u2019s solicitor general, fared little better in fending off questions from Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush. Judge Clifton said the states\u2019 evidence of religious discrimination was thin, adding that \u201cthe concern for terrorism with those connected with radical Islamic sects is kind of hard to deny.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Judge Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, did not seem persuaded that immediate suspension of travel from the seven countries was necessary. Photo \u201cHas the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism?\u201d she asked Mr. Flentje. He responded that the government had not had an opportunity to present evidence in court given the pace of the litigation. \u201cThese proceedings have been moving quite fast, and we\u2019re doing the best we can,\u201d Mr. Flentje said. With that, Judge Friedland said, the government\u2019s appeal may be premature. The case, State of Washington v. Trump, is in its earliest stages, and the question for the appeals court on Tuesday was a narrow one: Should it stay Judge Robart\u2019s temporary restraining order and reinstate the travel ban while the case proceeds? The argument, which lasted about an hour, was conducted over the telephone and was streamed live on the appeals court\u2019s website. In a media advisory issued before the argument, the court said that \u201ca ruling was not expected to come down today, but probably this week.\u201d Mr. Flentje said the travel ban was well within Mr. Trump\u2019s legal authority. A federal statute specifically gave presidents the power to deny entry to people whose presence would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States,\u201d he said. He added that the court should not question Mr. Trump\u2019s motives, and should confine itself instead to \u201cthe four corners of the document.\u201d He said the executive order did not, on its face, discriminate on the basis of religion. Mr. Purcell, the lawyer for Washington State, responded that the underlying purpose of the executive order was religious discrimination. As a candidate, Mr. Purcell said, Mr. Trump had \u201ccalled for a complete ban on the entry of Muslims.\u201d Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story As he closed his argument, Mr. Flentje, perhaps sensing that he was unlikely to achieve a complete victory, offered the court a middle ground. He asked, at a minimum, for the court to reinstate a part of the ban against people who have never been in the United States, calling this a \u201creally key point.\u201d Reading from a brief, he conceded that those who could be allowed entry are \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\u201d Judge Clifton said that the administration might be in a better position to narrow its executive order. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we look to the executive branch to more clearly define what the order means?\u201d he asked. Mr. Purcell also said that it was hard to tell precisely what distinctions the government meant to draw. \u201cThey\u2019ve changed their mind about five times\u201d since the executive order was issued, he said. Judge Friedland said that if the executive order violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion, the court could block it completely. But Judge Clifton said that only a small fraction of the world\u2019s Muslims were affected by the order, suggesting that he was unconvinced that its effect was religious discrimination. Photo Mr. Purcell responded that \u201cwe do not need to prove that this order harms only Muslims, or that it harms every Muslim.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe just need to prove that it was motivated in part by a desire to harm Muslims,\u201d he said. The judges also questioned whether the two states that brought the challenge had suffered the sort of direct and concrete harm that gave them standing to sue. The Supreme Court has said that states suing the federal government to defend their interests are entitled to \u201cspecial solicitude in our standing analysis.\u201d In 2015, an appeals court ruled that Texas had standing to sue the Obama administration to challenge an immigration initiative. But the case did not seem likely to stall on the threshold issue of standing. Judge Canby appeared to indicate that the harm to state universities was enough to establish standing. Nor were the judges much interested in another technical question pressed by Mr. Purcell. Judge Robart issued a temporary restraining order, an interim measure, and Mr. Purcell argued that it was not subject to appeal. In court papers, the Justice Department argued that the order amounted to a preliminary injunction, which can be appealed. Proceedings before Judge Robart are continuing. On Tuesday, he asked for briefs on the question of whether he should issue a preliminary injunction.

But the president did not appeal to the Supreme Court. Instead, he issued a revised executive order. The new order\u2019s 90-day suspension of entry from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was more limited and subject to case-by-case exceptions. It omitted Iraq, which had been listed in the earlier order, and it removed a complete ban on Syrian refugees. And it deleted explicit references to religion. Like the earlier order, the new one suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days and reduced the annual number of refugees to 50,000 from 120,000. Hawaii sued to challenge the revised executive order, saying it was the product of religious hostility. On March 15, Judge Derrick K. Watson, of the Federal District Court in Hawaii, blocked major parts of the revised order, saying they violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion.

In 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, took account of campaign materials from Chief Justice Roy S. Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court to judge his actions concerning a Ten Commandments monument in his courthouse. In the context of immigration and efforts to combat terror, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to look behind official actions to root out authentic motives. In 2006, in a case concerning detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, Justice John Paul Stevens criticized a dissenting justice for relying on \u201cpress statements\u201d from sitting Defense Department officials. \u201cWe have not heretofore, in evaluating the legality of executive action, deferred to comments made by such officials to the media,\u201d Justice Stevens wrote. If even statements from government officials are out of bounds, it would follow that statement from political candidates should carry no weight. In a 1972 immigration case concerning a Marxist scholar denied a visa, the Supreme Court similarly said it would not \u201clook behind\u201d the government\u2019s \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason.\u201d More recently, in a fractured 5-to-4 decision in 2015 with no majority opinion, the Supreme Court refused to second-guess the denial of a visa on national security grounds to the Afghan husband of an American woman. In a concurrence, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said it might be proper to look behind the offered reason for the denial if there were evidence that consular officer had acted in bad faith. On Wednesday, in a dissent in the Ninth Circuit, five judges said the 1972 decision should have been the end of the matter in a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s first executive order. \u201cEven if we have questions about the basis for the president\u2019s ultimate findings \u2014 whether it was a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 or something else \u2014 we do not get to peek behind the curtain,\u201d Judge Jay S.

Judge King said the two sides were separated by a wide gulf on the central question in the case: that of whether to interpret the order in isolation or in the context of the various statements. \u201cThat\u2019s where you all are like ships in the night,\u201d Judge King told Mr. Jadwat. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important issue in the whole case.\u201d The revised order, issued in March, sought to address judicial objections to an earlier one, issued in January. The first order, which caused chaos and drew protests at airports around the nation, was blocked in February by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. The new order\u2019s 90-day suspension of entry from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was more limited and subject to case-by-case exceptions. It omitted Iraq, which had been listed in the earlier order. It removed a complete ban on Syrian refugees. And it deleted explicit references to religion. Like the earlier order, the new one suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days and reduced the annual number of refugees to 50,000 from 120,000.

Chuang of Federal District Court in Maryland wrote in the decision under review by the appeals court. Judge Chuang\u2019s ruling blocked the part of the order concerning travel from the six countries. The court hearing the case on Monday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, did not follow its usual practices in considering the appeal. Ordinarily, a three-judge panel would have heard the case and decided it, with the possibility of full-court review afterward. Skipping that step and scheduling arguments before the full court signaled the exceptional importance of the case. So did the court\u2019s decision to allow C-Span to broadcast live audio coverage of the arguments. Nine of the judges who heard Monday\u2019s arguments were appointed by Democratic presidents and three by Republican ones. Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory was initially appointed by President Bill Clinton during a Senate recess and was later reappointed by President George W. Bush. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, recused himself, presumably because Mr. Wall, the government lawyer, is his son-in-law. Judge Allyson Kay Duncan, appointed by Mr. Bush, also disqualified herself, without giving a reason. Next Monday, the Ninth Circuit will hear a separate appeal of another decision blocking aspects of the revised travel ban, from the federal judge in Hawaii. That appeal will be heard by a three-judge panel. Mr. Wall argued that presidents have vast constitutional and statutory authority over immigration. Under a 1972 Supreme Court immigration decision, he said, judges should not second-guess the government\u2019s \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason\u201d for denying visas. More recently, in a fractured 5-to-4 decision in 2015 with no majority opinion, the Supreme Court refused to second-guess the denial of a visa on national security grounds to the Afghan husband of an American woman. In a concurrence, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said it might be proper to look behind the offered reason for the denial if there was evidence that the consular officer had acted in bad faith. Mr. Jadwat, the lawyer for the challengers, said Mr. Trump\u2019s statements were evidence of such bad faith. He added that cases claiming religious discrimination require a different analysis from the one courts usually use in immigration cases.

Two options in the appeals court On Friday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, asked the two sides to file briefs setting out their positions on whether a larger panel of the court should rehear the case. The administration could urge the court to do that. Were the Ninth Circuit to agree, the case would ordinarily be heard by an 11-member panel, including the circuit\u2019s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random. The court has a liberal reputation, but its judges have a wide variety of ideological leanings, and it is at least possible that such a panel would rule for Mr. Trump. But this strategy also requires time, and the case would still probably end up in the Supreme Court. The administration has a second option in the Ninth Circuit. It could continue to litigate the case before the three-judge panel. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The panel on Thursday set a schedule for submitting briefs in the underlying appeal. (Recall that the question decided on Thursday was whether to stay the trial court order and not whether it was correct.) The last of those briefs is due March 29. More proceedings in the trial court Judge James L. Robart, who entered the temporary restraining order, has also set a briefing schedule, on whether he should make his ruling more permanent by issuing a preliminary injunction. The last of those briefs is due Feb. 17. If the administration were inclined to submit additional evidence justifying the ban, the trial court would be the place to do it. But it is not clear whether there will be further proceedings before Judge Robart on whether he should issue a preliminary injunction. On Thursday, just after the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, a lawyer for Washington State wrote a letter to Judge Robart saying the appeals court had effectively entered the preliminary injunction. \u201cIn light of the court of appeals decision,\u201d Noah G. Purcell, Washington State\u2019s solicitor general, wrote, \u201cthe states assume the district court briefing schedule is no longer applicable. The states will not be filing a preliminary injunction motion and brief in the district court tonight, unless we receive contrary guidance from the district court.\u201d Many federal trial judges around the country have also addressed aspects of the travel ban, and Mr. Trump won a notable victory in Boston last week.

Unless the appeals court or the Supreme Court acts, Judge Robart\u2019s Feb. 3 temporary restraining order, which blocked the key provisions of targeted travel ban, will remain in place. The ban, one of the first executive orders Mr. Trump issued after taking office, suspended worldwide refugee entry into the United States. It also suspended travel from seven Muslim-majority nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 for 90 days. On Thursday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, refused to stay Judge Robart\u2019s order. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Friday, an unidentified appeals court judge called for a vote on whether the three-judge panel\u2019s ruling should be reheard by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. Those briefs are due Thursday. If a majority of the court\u2019s active judges voted to rehear the case, it would typically be considered by an 11-member panel made up of the circuit\u2019s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random. Rehearing motions filed by parties and requests for votes on rehearings requested by judges are not particularly unusual. The Ninth Circuit rehears decisions issued by three-judge panels 15 to 25 times a year, the court said. The Ninth Circuit has 25 active judges, 18 of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents. In a separate order, the three-judge panel last Thursday set a schedule for submitting briefs in the underlying appeal. (The question decided on Thursday was whether to stay the trial court order. The question at issue in the new briefs is whether that ruling was correct.) The last of those briefs is due March 29. Judge Robart, meanwhile, was considering on Monday what should happen in his court in the meantime. Last Friday, he asked the states and the Justice Department to file briefs on whether there was a need for further proceedings in his court. Ordinarily, after a temporary restraining order is issued, the parties would file additional briefs and perhaps submit evidence on whether to make the order more permanent by entering a preliminary injunction. Before the Ninth Circuit ruled, Judge Robart ordered the parties to file those briefs starting on Feb. 9 and ending on Feb. 17. But the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling complicated matters by treating the order as a preliminary injunction, suggesting that there was nothing more for Judge Robart to do for now. Mr. Purcell said that was the right interpretation of the appeals court\u2019s ruling. \u201cIn short, because the Ninth Circuit has construed the Feb. 3 order to grant all the preliminary relief the states would have sought through a motion for a preliminary injunction, no additional briefing or evidence is required in the district court on the propriety of preliminary relief,\u201d Mr. Purcell wrote.

Gorsuch to fill a seat left vacant for more than a year after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The new case will be an early indication of how Justice Gorsuch affects the balance of power on the court. A week into his presidency, on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump issued an executive order to ban travel from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. It also banned all Syrian refugees indefinitely. The order was blocked by the Ninth Circuit in February. In March, Mr. Trump issued a new, revised ban that narrowed the scope of his original order. It omitted Iraq from the countries that faced the travel scrutiny and allowed case-by-case exceptions for travelers from the others. It also removed the complete ban on Syrian refugees and deleted explicit references to religion. Like the earlier order, the new one suspended the nation\u2019s refugee program for 120 days and reduced the annual number of refugees to 50,000 from 110,000. In its brief, the Trump administration urged the court to place law above politics. \u201cThis order has been the subject of passionate political debate,\u201d the brief said. \u201cBut whatever one\u2019s views, the precedent set by this case for the judiciary\u2019s proper role in reviewing the president\u2019s national security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this order, and this constitutional moment.

Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, that blocked the key parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. Judge Robart\u2019s ruling allowed immigrants and travelers who had been barred from entry to come to the United States, and it inspired a harsh attack from Mr. Trump, who accused the judge of endangering national security.

Fifteen states and the District of Columbia \u2014 including New York, California, Massachusetts and Virginia \u2014 filed a supporting brief to argue that allowing the ban to stand would \u201ccause harm to the states, including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents.\u201d In a brief filed Saturday, the Trump administration argued that Judge Robart\u2019s order would cause irreparable harm to national security. In response, lawyers for Washington and Minnesota said that was not plausible, because it would mean the nation had long been suffering \u201csome unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm.\u201d \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d the brief said. \u201cAs this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\u201d On Monday, the Trump administration responded that the states were asking the courts \u201cto take the extraordinary step of second-guessing a formal national-security judgment made by the president himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority.\u201d In its earlier brief, the Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president\u2019s motives, the administration\u2019s brief said, would violate the separation of powers.

The order itself appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it will not enforce that part of the order. Questions about permanent residents are not moot, the states\u2019 brief said, as the administration could again change positions. Several former diplomatic and national security officials filed a declaration making a second kind of argument. \u201cWe view the order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,\u201d it said. \u201cIn our professional opinion, this order cannot be justified on national security or foreign policy grounds.\u201d The officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama; Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton; Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser; and Leon E.

Opponents of the ban have said it is a threat to the rule of law, to the nation\u2019s security, and to the economy. With the filing of the administration\u2019s brief, the challenge to the travel ban, the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Trump\u2019s young presidency, is ready for its most important judicial test yet, one that will yield the first appellate ruling.

Sign up for more newsletters here The appeals court has refused to immediately reinstate the ban, and lawyers for Washington and Minnesota, two states challenging it, argued that any resumption would unleash \u201cchaos\u2019\u2019 again, separating families and stranding university students. The Justice Department responded that the president has clear authority to \u2018\u2018suspend the entry of any class of aliens\u2019\u2019 to maintain national security. It said the travel ban was intended \u2018\u2018to permit an orderly review and revision of screening procedures to ensure that adequate standards are in place to protect against terrorist attacks.\u2019\u2019 Trial judges around the country, including in Boston, have blocked aspects of Trump\u2019s executive order suspending travel from seven mostly Muslim countries and limiting the nation\u2019s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court. And none of the lower-court rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump. That ruling, from Judge James L. Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, blocked the key parts of Trump\u2019s order. Robart\u2019s ruling allowed immigrants and travelers who had been barred to enter the United States, and it inspired an attack from Trump, who accused the judge of endangering national security. Advertisement On Saturday, the administration asked the Ninth Circuit for an immediate administrative stay of Robart\u2019s ruling without hearing from the plaintiffs. The court declined, instead asking for more briefs. The appeals court\u2019s order Saturday night was issued by Judge William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by Barack Obama. The third judge on the panel, Judge Richard R. Clifton, was appointed by George W. Bush. Now that the requested briefs have been filed, a ruling from the appeals court should follow soon. It will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court. The two states\u2019 appellate brief, filed early Monday, said Trump \u201cunleashed chaos by signing the executive order.\u201d Other states have joined the fray. Hawaii, which had filed a separate lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s order, moved to intervene Sunday. The next day, 15 states and the District of Columbia filed a brief supporting Washington and Minnesota. Massachusetts was among them, along with California, New York, and Virginia. Advertisement \u201cIf this court were to grant a stay,\u201d the supporting brief said, \u201cit would resurrect the chaos experienced in our airports beginning on the weekend of Jan. 28 and 29, and cause harm to the states \u2014 including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents.\u201d In a brief filed Saturday, the administration argued Robart\u2019s order would cause irreparable harm to national security. In response, lawyers for the two states said that was not plausible, as it would mean that the nation had long been suffering \u201csome unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm.\u201d \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d the brief said. \u201cAs this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\u201d In the short term, it could prove difficult to find the necessary five votes at the Supreme Court to undo a lower court order; the Supreme Court has been at less than full strength since Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death a year ago. The last immigration case that reached the justices ended in a 4-to-4 tie. But the travel ban expires in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before a higher court takes up the issue. The administration could change it in any number of ways that would keep the issue alive. The Supreme Court bench also could be full, with a new ninth justice on board, by the time the court is ready to hear arguments. If Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s nominee for the court, is confirmed this spring chances of a tie vote would disappear. On Saturday, the administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious bias, even though Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president\u2019s motives, the administration\u2019s brief said, would violate the separation of powers. Washington and Minnesota said \u201ccourts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants\u2019 true motives.\u201d They added that the administration had taken \u201ca dizzying number of positions\u201d on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it won\u2019t enforce that part of the order. Questions about permanent residents are not moot, the states said; the administration could again change positions. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey joined a coalition of 16 attorneys general in filing a brief in San Francisco opposing the immigration ban. The attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia argued Trump\u2019s order would have an adverse effect on the states as well as the interests of each state\u2019s residents and institutions, such as universities and businesses whose students and employees would be affected. \u201cWe now all stand together in facing concrete, immediate, and irreparable harms from the executive order,\u201d the states argued. Healey said Monday that \u201cno president or administration is more powerful than our laws and our Constitution. As state [attorneys general], it is our job to hold this administration accountable and stand for the interests of our states and our residents.\u201d Several former diplomatic and national security officials filed a declaration against the ban Monday, including John Kerry, secretary of state under Obama, and Madeleine Albright, who had the position in the Clinton administration. \u201cWe view the order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,\u201d the declaration said. After the Seattle court ruling, the State Department said people from the seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen \u2014 could travel to the United States if they had valid visas.

The Supreme Court remains short-handed and could deadlock. A 4-to-4 tie there would leave the appeals court\u2019s ruling in place. The administration has moved fast in the case so far, and it is likely to file an emergency application to the Supreme Court in a day or two. The court typically asks for a prompt response from the other side, and it could rule soon after it received one. A decision next week, either to reinstate the ban or to continue to block it, is possible. The travel ban, one of the first executive orders Mr. Trump issued after taking office, suspended worldwide refugee entry into the United States. It also barred visitors from seven Muslim-majority nations for up to 90 days to give federal security agencies time to impose stricter vetting processes. Immediately after it was issued, the ban spurred chaos at airports and protests nationwide as foreign travelers found themselves stranded at immigration checkpoints by a policy that critics derided as un-American. The State Department said up to 60,000 foreigners\u2019 visas were canceled in the days immediately after the ban was imposed. The World Relief Corporation, one of the agencies that resettles refugees in the United States, called the ruling \u201cfabulous news\u201d for 275 newcomers who are scheduled to arrive in the next week, many of whom will be reunited with family. \u201cWe have families that have been separated for years by terror, war and persecution,\u201d said Scott Arbeiter, the president of the organization, which will arrange for housing and jobs for the refugees in cities including Seattle; Spokane, Wash.; and Sacramento.

The administration has already sought a Supreme Court review of a similar decision issued last month by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Virginia. Monday\u2019s decision came from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, in San Francisco. The two courts employed different reasoning to arrive at the same basic conclusion. The 4th Circuit said the revised executive order violated the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of government establishment of religion. The 9th Circuit, by contrast, rested its conclusions on statutory grounds. It said Trump had exceeded the authority Congress granted him in making national security judgments in the realm of immigration without adequate justification. \u5e7f\u544a \u201cThe order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,\u201d the 9th Circuit\u2019s opinion said. \u201cNational security is not a \u2018talismanic incantation\u2019 that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power.\u201d The decision, from a three-judge panel, was unanimous. It was issued jointly by Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard A. Paez. All three were appointed by President Bill Clinton. The ruling affirmed most of a March decision from Judge Derrick K. Watson, of the U.S. District Court in Hawaii. But the appeals court narrowed the injunction issued by Watson in a significant way. The appeals court said Watson had erred in barring the administration from conducting internal reviews of its vetting procedures while the case moved forward. That may turn out to be important as the Supreme Court considers how to address the two cases. The key part of the executive order suspended travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days to give the administration time to conduct a review of its vetting procedures. If that review can soon be completed, the justices may decide that the case will soon be moot.

It appears to set the stage for a battle in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which last month upheld a ruling blocking Trump\u2019s original travel ban. The case, brought by Hawaii Atty. Gen.

But the case also could vanish into the legal ether, and that may be what a majority of the court is hoping for. Getting rid of the case would allow the justices to avoid second-guessing the president on a matter of national security or endorsing an especially controversial part of Trump's agenda. The timetable surrounding the travel ban could make that possible. The court will hear a challenge to the temporary pauses on visitors from six mostly Muslim countries and refugees worldwide in less than a month. But even before that happens, the 90-day travel ban expires on Sept. 24. The refugee ban lapses a month later. The administration has yet to say whether it will impose new bans, how long they might last and what countries may be affected. Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are the six countries covered by the existing ban. The high court could react by ruling that a new lawsuit is necessary or ordering lower courts that have handled the challenges so far to assess the new policy. So far, the court has stepped in three times to evaluate what parts of the policy can take effect even as legal challenges proceed in the courts. Chief Justice John Roberts may have the most at stake among the justices in finding a way out of the case without passing judgment on the controversy over a policy Trump talked about during the campaign and then rolled out a week into his presidency. \"It creates political controversy whether the court approves or rejects the travel ban,\" said Ilya Shapiro, editor-in-chief of the libertarian Cato Institute's Supreme Court review. Shapiro said Roberts would strongly prefer any way to get the case out of his court rather than come down on either side of tough questions dealing with the Constitution and immigration law. Top Justice Department officials in previous Democratic and Republican administrations agreed. \"There's incentive to not decide very much at all,\" said Donald Verrilli, the solicitor general for most of President Barack Obama's tenure. Several other justices may be willing to help Roberts get there, said Jeffrey Rosen, president of the National Constitution Center. The court's pronouncements about the travel ban so far have either been by consensus or a six-justice majority including the more conservative Roberts, Justice Anthony Kennedy and the four more liberal members of the court, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. \"The liberal justices, especially the pragmatic liberals Breyer and Kagan, will do anything to allow Roberts to avoid a substantive constitutional decision,\" Rosen said. In part, their motivation stems from a widely held view that the case is difficult to predict. Presidents have substantial power over immigration and courts typically are reluctant to undercut executive authority, especially when presidents say national security is at stake. That argument is at the heart of the administration's defense of the Trump policy. The challenges shouldn't have made it this far, the administration has told the court. On the other side, opponents of Trump's policy have persuaded two federal appeals courts that Trump has either overstepped his authority under immigration law or violated the Constitution's protections against religious bias. Trump's campaign statements calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and tweets while president have figured in the rulings. Just last week, Trump returned to the travel ban after a bomb partially exploded on a London subway. \"The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific \u2014 but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\" At one point in July, the court hashed out an order when Roberts was in Australia, Kennedy was in Austria and other justices were in time zones in between. The product of their collaboration was an unsigned order that said grandparents, cousins and other similar relations could not be excluded under the travel ban, while refugees who already had a relationship with resettlement agencies in the U.S. could be kept out of the country. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, would have let the administration set more restrictive conditions on family members from the six countries. The outcome appeared to be the product of \"cross-party consensus about what to do,\" said Irv Gornstein, executive director of Georgetown law school's Supreme Court Institute. Justices rarely explain what goes on in their private deliberations, but in late July Ginsburg offered a peek to an audience in Aspen, Colorado. The court's three grandparents were unhappy with one aspect of the travel ban, she said. \"The government's restrictive interpretation had no provision for grandparents. I commented that three justices are obviously not going to put up with that \u2014 Justice Kennedy, Justice Breyer and me,\" Ginsburg said. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The biggest news of all, though, would be if Justice Anthony Kennedy were to use the court's last public session on Monday to announce his retirement. To be sure, Kennedy has given no public sign that he will retire this year and give President Donald Trump his second high court pick in the first months of his administration. Kennedy's departure would allow conservatives to take firm control of the court. But Kennedy turns 81 next month and has been on the court for nearly 30 years. Several of his former law clerks have said they think he is contemplating stepping down in the next year or so. Kennedy and his clerks were gathering over the weekend for a reunion that was pushed up a year and helped spark talk he might be leaving the court. \"Soon we'll know if rumors of Kennedy's retirement are accurate,\" one former Kennedy clerk, George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, said on Twitter Friday. When the justices take the bench Monday, they are expected to decide the case of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Missouri, which was excluded from a state grant program to pay for soft surfaces on playgrounds run by not-for-profit groups. The case is being closely watched by advocates of school vouchers, who hope the court will make it easier to use state money to pay for private, religious schooling in states that now prohibit it. Missouri has since changed its policy under Republican Gov. Eric Greitens so that churches may now apply for the money. Also expected in the next few days, though there's no deadline by which the court must decide, is a ruling on whether to allow the administration to immediately enforce a 90-day ban on visitors from six mostly Muslim countries. Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, could play a pivotal role in both the travel ban and church playground cases. In all, six cases that were argued between November and April remain undecided.

The justices did make a number of significant rulings. They decided to allow a limited version of President Donald Trump's ban on travel from six mostly Muslim countries take effect and to set the case for argument in the fall. In a highly watched religious liberty case, the court sided with a church that had sought a grant to put a soft surface on its preschool playground. And the justices said they'll take on a new clash between gay rights and religion in a case about a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in Colorado. The justices also sent back to a lower court a case involving the shooting of a Mexican teenager by a U.S. Border Patrol agent. The question the court was asked to resolve was whether the parents of the teen could sue in U.S. courts. The justices told a federal appeals court to take account of a Supreme Court ruling last week that limits damages claims against high-ranking U.S. officials. The justices will begin to hear cases again Oct. 2. Until then, they're off to summer activities, which for Kennedy includes spending part of the summer as he typically does, teaching a law school class in Salzburg, Austria.

His words and actions precede him. Trump's planned drop-by for the official investiture of Justice Neil Gorsuch comes as the president's lawyers make almost daily filings with the justices in an attempt to revive his ban on refugees and travelers from six mostly Muslim countries. The court could decide by next week whether to allow Trump's executive order to go into effect or follow the lead of lower courts that have stopped the order because they say it exceeds the president's authority and discriminates unconstitutionally. It's unlikely the high-stakes legal maneuvering will be mentioned Thursday, nor Trump's blasts at the federal judiciary in general and some of the justices specifically. Trump has called Chief Justice John Roberts \"an absolute disaster\" for conservatives. After Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in interviews last summer called Trump a \"faker\" and said she feared for the country if he were elected, Trump responded by saying that \"her mind is shot\" and that she should retire. Since then, Roberts administered the oath of office to Trump on Inauguration Day, and all of the justices attended a Rose Garden ceremony after the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination. Differences traditionally are put aside for a new justice's investiture, a short but formal and history-laden event that culminates in iconic photos of the chief justice and the new justice descending the Supreme Court's famous marble steps. Gorsuch actually joined the court April 10 and earlier this week delivered his first opinion. At the last investiture ceremony in 2010, for his nominee Elena Kagan, President Barack Obama mingled beforehand with the justices he had criticized in his previous State of the Union address for their decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. \"You're always welcome here,\" the chief justice told the president during the ceremony. But it is rare for the court and the president to get together when such an important executive branch priority is pending. Trump signed his first executive order imposing a travel ban just after he was inaugurated in January. It was struck down by a judge in Washington state, and that decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Even though Trump vowed to take his initial ban to the Supreme Court then, his administration instead issued in March what Trump later tweeted was a \"watered-down\" version. The revised ban suspends travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days to give the administration time to conduct a review of whether proper vetting procedures are in place to ensure travelers are not a threat to national security. The order also suspends the nation's refugee program for 120 days and imposes a new limit on the number of refugees accepted. A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit just this week upheld the decision of a federal judge in Hawaii to keep that executive order from going into effect. The judges said that Congress had given the president great power in immigration decisions but that Trump had not shown national security warranted the actions he had taken. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, meanwhile, said banning travelers from the six countries was really just a way for Trump to make good on his campaign promise of a ban on Muslims. That was an unconstitutional form of discrimination, the court said in a 10-to-3 ruling. The Supreme Court is now being asked to lift the stays and accept the case for oral argument. The court granted the administration's request that briefing on the issue be extended to June 21. But the court is scheduled to end its term June 26, so that would seem to mean even if the court accepted the case, it would not be scheduled for argument until the fall. Steve Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor who has closely followed the litigation, said the proposal is \"not the kind of move you'd expect from a government in a hurry.\" The pause on immigration was supposed to be only so the administration could ensure proper vetting procedures were in place. The 9th Circuit opinion said the administration was free to undertake that study but without the travel ban. That lessens the government's need to lift the stays, Vladeck said, unless the real objective of the executive order is to block travelers, rather than to ensure the proper vetting procedures are in place.

The high-stakes legal fight has been going on since President Donald Trump rolled out a travel ban just a week after his inauguration. He casts it as critical to deterring terror attacks in the United States. Trump seeks to halt visits from residents of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days so his administration can review the screening procedures for visa applicants from those countries. Opponents argue that the ban targets Muslims in violation of federal law and the Constitution, and that it stems from Trump's campaign pledge to halt the entry of all Muslims into the U.S. Lower federal courts have so far agreed and blocked the travel ban. One court also has blocked a 120-day halt on refugee arrivals in the United States. A look at several ways the Supreme Court could decide what to do: ___ IMMEDIATE BAN ON TRAVEL With the votes of five justices, the court could agree to the administration's request to immediately reinstate the travel ban, which Trump has said would go into effect 72 hours after a favorable court ruling. The administration has said the revised travel ban Trump issued in March would avoid the chaos and confusion at airports that followed the initial travel order in January. That's because the new policy does not apply to people already in the U.S. or with a valid visa at the time the ban takes effect, the administration has said. Opponents still worry people will be caught in legal limbo if the ban is enforced. ___ KEEP THE TRAVEL BAN ON HOLD The court could side with opponents of the ban and refuse to let it take effect. But the administration could still conduct the 90-day review that Trump had tied to the travel ban and a revised executive order could follow. A new ban might include more countries or be made permanent, or both. A new policy almost certainly would lead to new legal challenges. ___ ARGUMENT IN FRONT OF THE COURT Whether the court immediately allows the ban to take effect or keeps it blocked, the justices might schedule argument on the issue for the fall. But there is a fair prospect that the argument \u2014 if it even takes place \u2014 would be a sideshow. This week's court action is the main event. That's because the 90-day ban will have run its course before any argument takes place in the fall and, if the ban remains on hold, a new travel policy might be in place. ___ ANY CHANCE OF ARGUMENT RIGHT AWAY? Opponents of the travel ban had suggested, under certain circumstances, that the court could hear argument and issue a decision almost immediately, before the justices leave town for the summer. That prospect always seemed remote, and is even more so during the final week of June, with the court scheduled to issue the term's final opinions on Monday. Also, the court has worked at such a fast pace only rarely and usually in the midst of political crises, including the dispute over the 2000 presidential election and President Richard Nixon's refusal to turn over the Watergate tapes in 1974. ___ DENYING THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPEAL The court could effectively end the legal case by rejecting both the plea to enforce the ban and the administration's appeal of the lower court rulings. The White House could then prepare a new travel policy. The court might be reluctant to pursue this option because the justices, not lower courts, typically are the final word when a federal law or presidential action is struck down. ___ A FULL BENCH With Justice Neil Gorsuch's confirmation in April, the court now is at full strength. Gorsuch is sure to take part in weighing the ban proposed by the president who nominated him. He was a federal judge, and had no involvement in the formulation or roll out of the travel policy. As a comparison, Justice Elena Kagan resisted calls to step aside from the high court's consideration of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Some opponents of the law said that Kagan did enough as a Justice Department official in preparing the administration's legal defense to sit out the case.

The nine justices are taking up several high-profile, difficult cases. This follows a term in which they were mostly shorthanded after Justice Antonin Scalia's death, and avoided controversial issues. President Donald Trump tapped Gorsuch for Scalia's seat. The new justice joined the court in April. The term's first argument Monday is a major clash between businesses and their employees, focused on how workers can complain about pay, conditions and other issues. Employers want to be able to enforce a provision of millions of contracts that forces workers with complaints to go to arbitration individually, rather than in groups. The employees say going it alone is too costly, makes it impossible to pool resources to hire a lawyer and opens them to retaliation. Sheila Hobson, a former employee at a Murphy Oil USA gas station in Calera, Alabama, objected to taking a survey of competitors' gas prices that she said took 30 to 90 minutes a day without pay, on her way to and from work. \"I am a very simple person, believe in right and wrong and have a passion for what I believe in,\" Hobson said in a telephone news conference arranged by groups backing the employees. She had signed an employment contract with a provision requiring any dispute to be settled in individual arbitration. Hobson and three co-workers tried to sue the company in court, but the case was dismissed. Hobson then complained to the National Labor Relations Board, which found that the requirement for individual arbitration violates federal labor laws. The Trump administration reversed the Obama administration's position in support of the NLRB. The result is that government lawyers representing the Justice Department and the NLRB will oppose each other in court Monday. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she's never seen that in nearly 25 years on the high court. Even before the justices take the bench, the court is expected to reject hundreds of appeals that accumulated over the summer, after adding nine cases last week. One high-profile case could disappear, at least for now. The court canceled the Oct. 10 argument over Trump's travel ban after the president announced a new policy last week that differs from the one the justices had decided to review. Still, many important cases remain that touch on gay rights and religious freedoms, the polarized American electorate, the government's ability to track people without search warrants, states' rights to allow betting on professional and college sporting events and the ability of labor unions that represent government employees to collect \"fair share\" fees for contract negotiations from workers who don't support the unions.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-10-02", "authors": ["mark sherman"], "type": "article", "id": 283, "author_string": "mark sherman"}, {"title": "Trump takes aim at judges, saying 'a bad high school student' would see the law favors him", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-blasts-horrible-dangerous-and-1486563537-htmlstory.html", "text": "President Trump accused federal judges Wednesday of playing politics by suspending his travel ban and forcefully went after the appeals judges who are deciding whether to uphold that decision. \"It\u2019s a sad day,\" Trump said. \"I think our security is at risk today, and it will be at risk until we get what we are entitled to.\" Speaking to a gathering of police chiefs in Washington, Trump put on a highly public show of trying to sway the judges. They heard arguments a day earlier in the lawsuit over his executive order suspending all refugee admissions and canceling visas from seven majority-Muslim countries. Trump read directly from the Immigration and Nationality Act that lays out what powers the president has to stop legal entry into the U.S. in times of crisis. \u201cA bad high school student would understand this,\u201d Trump said, arguing his central point that the law gives him expansive power to block foreigners from entering the country. \"This is a weapon that you need, and they are trying to take it away from you maybe because of politics, maybe because of political views,\" Trump told the law enforcement officers, referring to his order. Trump's remarks were an unusually aggressive effort by a sitting president to influence an ongoing court case in which he is involved. He said he had listened Tuesday night to a broadcast of the arguments before judges from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The three-judge panel will decide whether to strike down or uphold a lower-court ruling temporarily suspending the enforcement of Trump's travel ban. Civil liberties advocates and Democrats have argued that Trump's travel ban unfairly blocks entry for Muslims, as he promised to do on the campaign trail. That would violate the constitutional restriction on the government favoring one religion over another, they argue. The appeals court won't rule on whether the president's executive order conflicts with other constitutional protections. Some national security experts have said that the ban doesn't address the threats facing the country and could further embolden terrorists to strike against the U.S. \"If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!\" Trump tweeted earlier Wednesday.

Purcell or Justice Department attorney August E. Flentje had the upper hand. Both lawyers faced sharp questioning, but legal experts cautioned not to read too much into the matter. \"It seemed like Washington state had a better argument. The Department of Justice attorney really struggled with articulating why the executive order had to remain in place,\" said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But she added: \"The reason you can't read a lot into oral arguments is that it's the judges' job to perform a searching inquiry on both sides. I think people who haven't heard oral arguments may hear the questions for the Department of Justice and they say, 'Oh my God, these are such sharp questions, and maybe they don't agree at all with the federal government.'\" What's important to keep in mind, she said, is \"It's the judges' job to play devil's advocate. It's their job to help the attorneys articulate their best argument. It's their job to also try to convince their colleagues.\" Arthur Hellman, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, viewed the Justice Department attorney as not seeming \"very well prepared for the questions about standing, though he recovered a bit toward the end of his argument.\" \"I was surprised that he didn\u2019t have more examples of terrorist activities by people from the affected countries, even if the examples weren\u2019t in the record,\" Hellman said. During a series of tense questions directed at Purcell, Judge Richard Clifton seemed doubtful that arguments that the travel ban was anti-Muslim were valid, Hellman added. \"I was surprised at the tone of some of some of Judge Clifton\u2019s questions for the Washington state attorney,\" he said. \"He seemed almost angry. But later he was also a little hard on the federal government attorney.\" Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said he believed the judges could uphold a lower court decision halting the Trump administration's travel ban nationally. The Justice Department would then either ask for the full court to review a stay on Trump's travel rules or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue.

Here are the most important ones", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-trump-travel-ban-story-so-far-20170206-story.html", "text": "Since President Trump signed a sweeping executive order that temporarily banned entry for refugees, as well as other immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries, dozens of lawsuits have been filed amid widespread confusion over the new immigration rules. On Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco was considering new legal briefs on both sides after initially denying a request to reinstate the travel ban, whose enforcement was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Seattle on Friday. Appeals court judges in San Francisco scheduled a telephone hearing on the case for Tuesday afternoon. The circuit court set a rapid schedule for briefs on the case filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota, with major tech companies and former national security officials entering filings in support. The White House argues that presidential power over national security and immigration puts the law on its side. The states say Trump's order harms the economy and local residents who are from the listed countries, and also discriminates against Muslims. The fight over whether Trump's travel ban should be left in place as lawsuits proceed is likely to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, as is the broader challenge to the order. In the meantime, flights carrying passengers from the banned countries and refugees were landing at U.S. international airports. What\u2019s at stake? The Jan. 27 executive order included a 90-day ban on admission of nearly all citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also halted all refugee admissions for 120 days, indefinitely suspended admission of Syrian refugees and said the U.S. would give preference to refugees who are members of religious minorities. Immediately after that, hundreds of refugees, green card holders and visitors with valid visas were either detained at U.S. airports, deported upon landing or not allowed to board flights to the country. The Department of Justice later told a judge that Trump's move had resulted in 100,000 visas that were canceled around the world. The Department of State clarified the number to be less than 60,000. Who's fighting the president? The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse at the University of Michigan has counted dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration in connection with the executive order. Most were filed by legal permanent residents who were detained, deported or blocked from boarding flights to the the U.S. They were filed in federal district courts in Virginia, Massachusetts, California, the District of Columbia and elsewhere. Several states have also taken the administration to court, saying the immigration order harms their economies and residents. They include Virginia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Minnesota and Washington, and they have either joined onto already existing suits or launched their own. Who\u2019s winning? For the most part, it\u2019s not Trump. But all wins have been temporary, and final results could change as lawsuits proceed. One of the first legal wins was in a case by the American Civil Liberties Union, which requested an emergency halt to deportations of visa holders and won a stay from a federal judge in Brooklyn the night after the president's order was signed. Another challenge was won that evening in Virginia, where a federal judge issued an order to block deportations of immigrants detained at Dulles International Airport. A Massachusetts judge followed with a similar temporary order Jan. 29. Although civil rights groups viewed many of these as applying nationally, they weren\u2019t followed uniformly. In Los Angeles, a major national order came Wednesday when a federal judge said that any immigrant with a valid visa had to be let into the country. The suit, still proceeding, was filed on behalf of 28 Yemenis with visas who had been unable to travel to the U.S. But the biggest win for opponents of the order came Friday, when U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle ordered that Trump's ban be lifted nationwide while a suit by the states of Washington and Minnesota was litigated. Notably, Robart\u2019s action applied not only to immigrants with visas but also to refugees. He also ordered a stop to any religious preference on admissions. Robart said he thought the states had a good chance of winning the case. In all of the above cases, judges said keeping Trump's order intact would cause \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d a legal bar for immediately suspending it. What is Trump\u2019s case and what are the arguments against him? The White House says the president\u2019s order stems from his responsibility to protect national security and is based on a 65-year-old part of the of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. It says that \u201cwhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d On the other hand, another part of the act says there cannot be discrimination in regard to \u201cthe person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence\u201d when it comes to \u201cthe issuance of an immigrant visa.\u201d The arguments against the executive order have been multi-pronged, most alleging a violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution, as well as the Constitution\u2019s ban on government religion. The religion argument stems from the order\u2019s preference for admission of religious minorities, and also a TV interview Trump gave in which he said Christians would get preference. Lawyers have also cited Trump associate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said the order was a version of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the country.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-02-06", "authors": ["jaweed kaleem"], "type": "article", "id": 199, "author_string": "jaweed kaleem"}, {"title": "White House: Trump doesn't question judicial independence", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-na-essential-washington-updates-white-house-trump-doesn-t-question-1486497973-htmlstory.html", "text": "The White House again insisted Tuesday that the courts ultimately will find that President Trump's travel ban is constitutional, making its case hours before a hearing that could determine whether the administration can resume enforcement of the directive.

A three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit will join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in deciding whether Trump ran afoul of the Constitution when he tried to temporarily shut down the U.S. refugee program and suspend the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries. The 9th Circuit blocked Trump's first travel ban, and now a different set of judges on the panel will weigh a revised version. The 4th Circuit, which is based in Richmond, Va., heard arguments on the matter last week. The views of each side are familiar by now. Those challenging the ban say it is unconstitutional and motivated by Trump's desire to discriminate against Muslims, and they point to Trump's comments and those of his advisers as evidence to prove their case. The Justice Department argues that the executive order is well within the president's power, and that lower courts have been wrong to second-guess him on a matter of national security. Last week, a federal judge in Michigan ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other advisers \u2014 whose comments judges nationwide have pointed to as they have ordered to freeze the ban. That case is separate from the two that have put Trump's latest ban on hold. U.S. district judges in Hawaii and Maryland have ordered key sections of the president's order frozen, and to fully reinstate the measure, the Justice Department would have to win in both the 4th and 9th circuits \u2014 or escalate the dispute to the Supreme Court. The three judges considering the matter in the 9th Circuit \u2014 Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez \u2014 were appointed by President Bill Clinton. The 4th Circuit heard the case with all its judges, a step the 9th Circuit declined to take. Trump has not been shy about criticizing judges who rule against him, but he seems to have particular ire for the 9th Circuit. When U.S. District Judge William Orrick blocked his executive order on stripping federal funding from sanctuary cities, Trump incorrectly attributed the decision to the 9th Circuit as he wrote on Twitter, \"First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities \u2014 both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!\" Orrick is a lower-court judge whose rulings would be reviewed by the 9th Circuit. Trump then wrote that the circuit had a \"terrible record of being overturned\" \u2014 a claim that is highly debatable \u2014 and he said later that he had \"absolutely\" considered breaking up the court.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-05-14", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 251, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Judges could seek a middle ground on Trump's travel ban by shielding only certain travelers", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-judges-could-seek-a-middle-ground-on-1486679413-htmlstory.html", "text": "The government lawyer defending President Trump \u2019s foreign travel ban made an unusual closing plea when arguing this week before a panel of U.S. 9th Circuit Court judges.

The court's terse order means the administration cannot impose a blanket prohibition on people from those countries who have grandparents, aunts and uncles and other relatives in the United States. The Trump administration has advanced a stricter interpretation of what kind of family relationships could entitle a person to receive a U.S. visa, but a lower court in Hawaii ruled that the criteria were too tight. The Supreme Court's action on Wednesday had two parts. In one, the justices said they will not disturb the lower court's decision that expanded the definition of close family ties. But in another, the justice granted the government's request to put on hold a part of the lower court's order that would have made it easier for more refugees to enter the country. That order could have granted granted entry to about 24,000 refugees who were already working with resettlement agencies. Wednesday's unsigned, one-paragraph order gave no reasoning for the Supreme Court's action. Three justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - said they would have granted the administration's request to put the entire order on hold. The majority said the government's appeal of the lower court should go through normal channels, with the next stop at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The Justice Department reacted to the action only by saying it \"looks forward to presenting its arguments to the 9th Circuit.\" Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the court's action \"confirms we were right to say that the Trump Administration over-reached in trying to unilaterally keep families apart from each other.\" The National Immigration Law Center said that while \"family unity won today,\" it will continue to litigate \"to ensure that refugees can find the shelter they were offered by settlement agencies in the United States.\" The court's decision was the latest development in the Trump administration's nearly six-month effort to temporarily shut down the nation's refugee program and bar visitors from several Muslim-majority countries while officials examine vetting procedures. The Trump administration has said the effort was needed to protect the country. Challengers have fought the ban as an unconstitutional effort at keeping out Muslims, which Trump had advocated during the presidential campaign. The latest version of the ban bars visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. These restrictions and the refugee ban had been put on hold by lower courts. The Supreme Court will consider the merits of the challenge to the administration's travel ban on Oct. 10. In the meantime, the court said last month that the ban could go in effect and be applied to those without a connection to the United States, but that people with a \"bona fide relationship\" with a person or entity in the United States must be exempted from the ban. The justices did not define such a relationship but gave examples of what would qualify for the exemption: a close relative in the United States, a spot in an American university, a job offer or speaking engagement. The Trump administration interpreted the Supreme Court's requirement of a \"close familial relationship\" to be a parent, spouse, fiance, son or daughter, sibling, son-in-law or daughter-in-law in the United States. The government would continue to bar refugees who had an offer from a refugee resettlement operation. The challengers went back to U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson of Hawaii, who had earlier issued a nationwide injunction against the ban. Watson ruled last week that the government's \"narrowly defined list\" of exemptions was not supported by either the Supreme Court decision or by the law. \"Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\" Watson wrote. \"Indeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The government's definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\" He extended the exemptions to include those with grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. Watson wrote that refugees with an assurance from a resettlement agency are also exempt from the ban. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to stay Watson's ruling. His interpretation of what kinds of family relationships qualify \"empties the court's decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just 'close' family members, but virtually all family members,\" the administration said in its brief to the court. \"Treating all of these relationships as 'close familial relationships' reads the term 'close' out of the court's decision. The administration added that Watson's ruling would cover virtually all refugees. The state of Hawaii, which has led the challenge of the travel ban, told the justices that the government's argument was \"nonsense.\" Any rule that maintained grandparents are not part of a close familial relationship was suspect as applied both to those who sought visas and refugees, the state said in its brief to the court. \"That argument is as wrong as it sounds, and nothing in this court's opinion, the immigration laws, or common sense supports it,\" the state wrote.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-07-19", "authors": ["robert barnes"], "type": "article", "id": 363, "author_string": "robert barnes"}, {"title": "Appeals court declines to weigh in on Trump travel ban rules", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-travel-ban-rules-20170707-story.html", "text": "A federal appeals court panel late Friday declined to involve itself in the latest dispute over President Donald Trump's travel ban, meaning, at least for now, grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States cannot be exempted from the president's executive order. The ruling from a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is another blow to those who have challenged enforcement of the ban in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that lifted earlier freezes of it. The appeals court judges, however, did not address the merits of the challengers' claims but, rather, said they did not have jurisdiction to weigh in on the matter. The judges - Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez, all Clinton appointees - were the same ones that had earlier ruled against Trump and upheld a freeze on his ban. Trump has been critical of their ruling. It is unclear what might happen next. The judges seemed to suggest that although they could not get involved, the state of Hawaii, which is challenging the ban, could go back to a lower court judge. That judge, Derrick K. Watson, had on Thursday rebuffed a similar request, saying the matter should be taken up with the Supreme Court. In a statement, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the ruling \"makes clear that Judge Watson does possess the ability to interpret and enforce the Supreme Court's order, as well as the authority to enjoin against a party's violation of the Supreme Court's order placing effective limitations on the scope of the district court's preliminary injunction.\" \"We appreciate the Ninth Circuit for ruling so quickly and will comply,\" Chin said. At issue is how far the administration can go in keeping relatives of U.S. people out under the president's travel ban, which bars the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries. The Supreme Court had ruled late last month that the government could begin enforcing the measure, but not on those with \"a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\" with a person or entity in the United States. The court offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify. \"Close familial\" relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \"formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.\" The government put the measure into effect on June 29, suspending the refugee program and barring the issuance of new visas to residents of Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria without U.S. connections. Among family members, officials drew lines. The administration said it would let into the United States from the six affected countries parents, parents-in-law, siblings, spouses, children, sons and daughters, and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law of those already here. (Officials initially wanted to keep out fiances, but later relented.) Still banned, however, were grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. And the administration also said it would keep out refugees who had a formal assurance from a resettlement agency. Hawaii first went to Watson, asking him to clarify that such people could not be blocked. Watson wrote that he would not \"usurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court,\" and if those suing over the ban wanted relief, they should take their claims there. The state then asked the 9th Circuit to get involved and bar the government from enforcing the measure as it has been. \"These actions are grossly unlawful, and they inflict ongoing and irreparable harm to persons in the United States whose relatives and associates are being denied entry to this country each day,\" lawyers for the state wrote in a filing Friday. Without even hearing from the government, the appeals court judges ruled that Watson's order \"neither resulted in a final judgment nor engaged in action deemed immediately appealable,\" and they thus lacked jurisdiction to get involved themselves. But they seemed to give Hawaii a path forward, if the state merely styled its request to Watson not as a request for clarity, but as a call to enforce the Supreme Court's order. \"Finally, we note that although the district court may not have authority to clarify an order of the Supreme Court, it does possess the ability to interpret and enforce the Supreme Court's order, as well as the authority to enjoin against, for example, a party's violation of the Supreme Court's order placing effective limitations on the scope of the district court's preliminary injunction,\" the judges wrote. \"But Plaintiffs' motion before the district court was clear: it sought clarification of the Supreme Court's June 26 order, not injunctive relief. Because the district court was not asked to grant injunctive relief or to modify the injunction, we do not fault it for not doing so.\"", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-07-07", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 396, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "'What universe does that come from?' Judges criticize travel ban weeks before it heads to Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-travel-ban-appeals-court-20170829-story.html", "text": "A panel of U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judges heard arguments Monday in Seattle over how broadly President Trump\u2019s travel ban can be enforced, and seemed inclined to uphold exemptions that let U.S. residents\u2019 relatives continue to arrive from banned countries. The judges, Michael Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez, who will issue their opinion later, will not decide whether the ban is legal. That question, one the same judges considered this year in a decision that suspended the ban, is left to the U.S. Supreme Court to take on when it hears arguments over the issue in about six weeks. Instead, the judges are looking at who falls under the ban. They prodded lawyers from the Trump administration and the state of Hawaii, which has sued, about how immigration law applies to Supreme Court orders on who is exempt from it. Trump originally signed the ban in January before it was blocked in federal courts. It was then modified and struck down again before the Supreme Court resurrected a limited version of it. The ban, which went into effect on June 29, prevents travel to the U.S. by nationals of Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Iran for 90 days. Separately, it stops all refugee resettlement for 120 days. But the Supreme Court said that it can\u2019t apply to anyone who has a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship to a person or entity in the U.S. Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Hashim Mooppan argued that the court should strengthen the ban by removing exemptions for people with specific relatives, such as grandparents, in the U.S. Currently, banned nationals can still travel if they have a grandparent in the U.S. Gould, who like the other judges is a President Clinton appointee, seemed skeptical of the idea. \u201cHow can the government take the position that a grandmother or a grandfather, or aunt or uncle, of a child in the U.S. does not have a close familial relationship? Like, what universe does that come from?\u201d he asked. Paez also seemed to not buy what opponents have derided as the \u201cgrandma ban.\u201d He asked why the government accepted in-law parents as legitimate U.S. connections but not grandparents. \u201cCould you explain to me what's significantly different between a grandparent and a mother-in-law, father-in-law?\" Paez asked. \"What is so different about those two categories? One is in and one is out.\u201d But the judges were less critical of the refugee ban, which has blocked most refugees from resettling in the country since the it went into place this summer. Refugees who have family members in the U.S. can resettle. They include about 900 who were allowed in since July. But travel ban opponents say the ban still blocks 24,000 refugees who have been given formal assurance that the U.S. government would allow them to resettle under a 110,000-person refugee cap that President Obama put in place before he left office. Trump\u2019s ban slashed that number by more than half to 50,000. The cap runs through the fiscal year that ends in September. Mooppan said in court that such formal assurances did not count as \u201cbona fide\u201d connections of refugees to the U.S. or to a resettlement agency. \u201cThe refugee assurance does not create any relationship between the resettlement agency and the refugee. It\u2019s a relationship between the resettlement agency and the government,\u201d which contracts out to the agencies to help immigrants settle in the U.S., Mooppan said. In less than an hour of arguments, the judges also questioned Colleen Roh Sinzdak, an attorney from the law firm Hogan Lovells who represented the state of Hawaii. At one point, Sinzdak attempted to point out to the panel that courts had previously found the travel ban to be illegal, but Hawkins cut her off. \u201cWe\u2019re not here on the merits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to shape a remedy that will satisfy the United States Supreme Court so when they hear the case in a couple of months on the merits, they can make an appropriate decision.\u201d Aside from a handful of examples \u2014 such as people who have university admission and employment offers in the U.S. and those residing in the U.S. who have mother-in-laws abroad \u2014 the Supreme Court in June did not define what counts as a bona fide U.S. connection. The lack of clarity has led to a series of lawsuits. After the Supreme Court decision, the Trump administration issued guidelines saying that family connections included only people with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, fiance or fiancee, or a parent-in-law in the U.S. And while thousands of refugees had been approved for resettlement, the administration said a relationship to a resettlement agency by itself did not constitute a bona fide U.S. connection for those immigrants. Then last month, a federal district judge in Hawaii ruled that exceptions had to be made for grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law. The judge, Derrick K. Watson, also disagreed with the Trump administration about refugees. He ordered that refugee agencies could count as bona fide connections and cleared the way for more refugee travel. The Trump administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which placed a hold on the judge\u2019s ruling on refugees until the 9th Circuit could consider the case. In the meantime, lawyers have started filing briefs on the travel ban\u2019s constitutionality to the Supreme Court.

The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is a blow to the government, which after the most recent Supreme Court compromise had been allowed to block refugees with assurances, though not grandparents and other extended relatives. \"Resettlement agencies will face concrete harms and burdens if refugees with formal assurances are not admitted,\" the judges wrote. \"In the same way that the Court considered the harms of the U.S. citizen who wants to be reunited with his mother-in-law and the permanent resident who wants to be reunited with his wife, the employer that hired an employee, the university that admitted a student, and the American audience that invited a lecturer, the district court correctly considered the resettlement agency that has given a formal assurance for specific refugees.\" The judges also said their ruling would take effect in just five days, a significant decrease from the normal 52 days, saying that refugees' lives \"remain in vulnerable limbo\" in their current, uncertain state. The government has estimated there are about 24,000 refugees with a formal assurance. The ruling does not drive to the heart of whether the travel ban is lawful. The Supreme Court is still scheduled to hear arguments on that next month. And given that the measure was supposed to have been temporary - 90 days for citizens of the six countries affected by the ban and 120 days for refugees - it is also possible that the dispute will be moot by then. In the 9th Circuit, the parties had essentially been arguing over who could be excluded from entering the United States after the justices in June ruled that a limited version of the travel ban could take effect. The high court had said officials could not enforce the measure on those with \"a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\" with a person or entity in the United States, but offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify. \"Close familial\" relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \"formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.\" The same standard applied to both citizens of the six countries affected by the ban, as well as all refugees. The government initially sought to block grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the country from entering, along with refugees with a formal assurance letter from a resettlement agency, but a U.S. district judge ultimately stopped them from doing so. The Supreme Court then put on hold the portion of that district judge's ruling on refugees, but not on grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States. That led to the legal wrangling before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit judges wrote that the government had not offered persuasive evidence that grandparents and other extended relatives did not count as \"close\" family members, rejecting the government's argument that they had drawn their position from immigration law. They rejected similar arguments on refugees with assurances. The 9th Circuit opinion was written by judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez, all appointed by President Bill Clinton.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-09-07", "authors": ["matt zapotosky"], "type": "article", "id": 398, "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Supreme Court blocks new refugees under Trump travel ban", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-supreme-court-blocks-new-refugees-under-1505255496-htmlstory.html", "text": "The Supreme Court gave a short-term win to the Trump administration Tuesday, bolstering part of a travel ban that will allow the administration to block new refugees arriving from six majority-Muslim nations.

The 9th Circuit had cleared the way for as many as 24,000 refugees to be exempt from the ban and come to this country as long as one of several nonprofit groups had given a \"formal assurance\" they were prepared to receive them. Administration lawyers argued these people did not qualify for an exemption because they had \"no contact\" or previous relationship with anyone in this country, which was the criteria set under a previous Supreme Court decision. On Monday, government lawyers filed an emergency appeal with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who agreed to a temporary freeze. On Tuesday, the full court said it had granted the administration's appeal.

He wrote that officials also could block refugees with a formal assurance from a resettlement agency. The administration had wanted to keep such people out, and thought a recent Supreme Court ruling partially lifting lower courts' freezes on the travel ban allowed them to do so. But those who had sued over the ban disagreed, and they asked Watson to intervene. In his ruling Watson said the state of Hawaii could directly ask the Supreme Court to clarify its ruling. The Supreme Court had ruled late last month that the government could begin enforcing the measure, but not on those with \"a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\" with a person or entity in the United States. The court offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify. \"Close familial\" relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \"formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.\" The government put the measure into effect on June 29, suspending the refugee program and barring the issuance of new visas to residents of Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria without U.S. connections. But for opponents of the ban the administration's interpretation of who had a connection was too narrow. The administration said it would let in to the United States from the six affected countries parents, parents-in-law, siblings, spouses, children, sons and daughters and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law of those already here. (Officials initially wanted to keep out fiances, but later relented.)

A 120-day ban on refugees also is being allowed to take effect on a similar, limited basis. Three of the court's conservative justices said they would have let the administration apply the bans without the limits imposed by their colleagues. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, said the government has shown it is likely to win the legal case in the end. Thomas said the government's interest in preserving national security outweighs any hardship to people denied entry into the country. Trump hailed the court's order as a \"clear victory for our national security,\" especially after lower court rulings that blocked the travel ban in its entirety. He said in a statement that his \"number one responsibility\" is to keep Americans safe. His administration's implementation plans, largely orchestrated by White House adviser Stephen Miller, focus on refusing entry to people who are unable to show a substantial and pre-existing tie to a person or institution in the United States. The plans were described by a senior official who was familiar with them, speaking on condition of anonymity because this person was not authorized to discuss them publicly by name. But some immigration lawyers said relatively few people would fall under the ban because people coming to study, work or visit family members already have sufficient relationships with others already is in the country. \"This order, properly construed, should really allow for only the narrowest implementation of any part of the ban.

The court's opinion explained the kinds of relationships people from the six countries must demonstrate to obtain a U.S. visa. \"For individuals, a close familial relationship is required,\" the court said. For people who want to come to the United States to work or study, \"the relationship must be formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course, not for the purpose of evading\" the travel ban. The opinion faulted the two federal appeals courts that had blocked the travel policy for going too far to limit Trump's authority over immigration. The president announced the travel ban a week after he took office in January and revised it in March after setbacks in court. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said the ban was \"rooted in religious animus\" toward Muslims and pointed to Trump's campaign promise to impose a ban on Muslims entering the country as well as tweets and remarks he has made since becoming president. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the ban does not comply with federal immigration law, including a prohibition on nationality-based discrimination. That court also put a hold on separate aspects of the policy that would keep all refugees out of the United States for 120 days and cut by more than half, from 110,000 to 50,000, the cap on refugees in the current government spending year that ends Sept. 30. Trump's first executive order on travel applied to travelers from Iraq and well as the six countries, and took effect immediately, causing chaos and panic at airports as the Homeland Security Department scrambled to figure out whom the order covered and how it was to be implemented.

The country is waiting for the court to make its decision public about the biggest legal controversy in the first five months of Trump's presidency. The issue has been tied up in the courts since Trump's original order in January sparked widespread protests just days after he took office. The justices met Thursday morning for their last regularly scheduled private conference in June and probably took a vote about whether to let the Trump administration immediately enforce the ban and hear the administration's appeal of lower court rulings blocking the ban. The court's decision could come any time and is expected no later than late next week, after which the justices will scatter for speeches, teaching gigs and vacations. Exactly when could depend on whether there are justices who disagree with the outcome and want to say so publicly. It might take time for such an opinion to be written \u2014 and perhaps responded to by someone in the majority. It takes five votes to reinstate the ban, but only four to set the case for argument. Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's nominee who was confirmed in April, is taking part in the highest-profile issue yet in his three months on the court. The case is at the Supreme Court because two federal appellate courts have ruled against the Trump travel policy, which would impose a 90-day pause in travel from citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said the ban was \"rooted in religious animus\" toward Muslims and pointed to Trump's campaign promise to impose a ban on Muslims entering the country as well as tweets and remarks he has made since becoming president. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the travel policy does not comply with federal immigration law, including a prohibition on nationality-based discrimination.

In March, Trump issued a narrower order, but it too has been blocked. The justices have a range of options. They could immediately allow the administration to stop travel from the six countries and hear arguments on the administration's broader appeal in October. That's the path the administration has urged. But the 90-day ban will have run its course by then, and there might be little left for the court to rule on. The government has said the ban was needed to allow for an internal review of the screening procedures for visa applicants from the six countries. That too should be complete before the Supreme Court reconvenes for its new term on October 2. The administration also could issue a new ban that includes more countries or is permanent, or both. That might make the current case go away and also could give rise to new legal challenges. The high court also might keep the ban on hold, but set the case for argument in October. This course might be palatable both to justices who object to the ban and those who don't like the breadth of the lower court rulings against the president. But it also could mean that a new policy is in effect before the court ever hears the case. The justices also could keep the ban from being reinstated and, at the same time, decline to review the lower court rulings. That outcome would essentially end the case.

US District Court Judge Theodore Chuang imposed a nationwide halt to the portion of the President's executive order that tried to bar foreign nationals from six majority-Muslim nations from entering the country for 90 days.

In their Friday motion, government lawyers had asked Watson to revise his ruling to say it did not apply to the refugee ban or to the government studies and reports. Federal lawyers did not abandon their argument that Trump's executive order is constitutional but said the judge should limit his ruling to the six-country ban. \"The motion, in other words, asks the court to make a distinction that the federal defendants' previous briefs and arguments never did. As important, there is nothing unclear about the scope of the court's order\u2026. The federal defendants' motion is denied,\" Watson wrote on Sunday. If Watson had granted the request, the Hawaii ruling would have largely matched a Maryland federal court order against the travel ban that was issued on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang. The Maryland judge declined to rule against the pause and cap on refugees. The Department of Justice has appealed Chuang's decision to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va. It could also appeal last week's Hawaii ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The original travel ban, signed Jan. 27, was blocked in federal district courts and the 9th Circuit. The new ban, signed March 6 and scheduled to go into effect March 16, was modified in an attempt to pass court muster.

The decision struck down, at least temporarily, the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to pause all refugee resettlement for 120 days and block citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 90 days. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson said his ruling applies nationwide. It appears to set the stage for a battle in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which last month upheld a ruling blocking Trump\u2019s original travel ban. \u00bb UPDATE: Federal judge in Maryland blocks Trump's revised travel ban Ruling separately in a Maryland federal court Thursday, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang issued a more limited order halting the travel ban. Chuang\u2019s ruling focused on blocking the ban\u2019s provision that paused immigration from the six countries. Speaking at a rally in Nashville on Wednesday after the court decision landed, Trump said it was a \u201cterrible ruling\u201d that \u201cmakes us look weak.\u201d He called it \u201cunprecedented judicial overreach\u201d and vowed to \u201ctake our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.\u201d Trump said the new order was simply a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version of the prior one. \u201cI think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way,\u201d he told the roaring crowd. The case, brought by Hawaii Atty. Gen. Douglas Chin, argued that the latest travel ban would have \"profound\" and \"detrimental\" effects on residents, businesses and universities. In its complaint, the state of Hawaii also said the executive order discriminates against Muslims and violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the U.S. Constitution. Lawyers for the state also argued that the order illegally discriminates based upon nationality. Arguing that Hawaii residents would be unfairly affected by the ban, lawyers cited the example of Ismail Elshikh, a naturalized U.S. citizen who is the imam of the Muslim Assn. of Hawaii. His mother-in-law is a national of Syria and would be barred from seeing her son-in-law. In his 43-page order, Watson, who was nominated to the bench by President Obama, repeatedly referred to statements by Trump and his associates during the campaign and afterward as evidence that the executive order was intended to restrict Muslim immigration. Watson wrote that despite the ban\u2019s \u201cstated secular purpose,\u201d Trump\u2019s own words acted against him by marking the travel order as a fulfillment of the president\u2019s campaign promise to temporarily bar all Muslims from entering the U.S. \u201cThe illogic of the government\u2019s contention is palpable,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cThe notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.\u201d Government lawyers have argued that the travel restrictions did not amount to a Muslim ban, as opponents have said, since they only would apply to a fraction of the world\u2019s Muslim population. The Department of Justice pushed back against the Hawaii court late Wednesday but did not indicate its next steps in the case. \"The Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the federal district court's ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and in scope,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe president's executive order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation's security, and the department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts.\" The Hawaii hearing was among four court proceedings Wednesday in which the travel ban was challenged. There were two hearings in Seattle and another in Greenbelt, Md. I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way. \u2014 President Trump Lawyers challenging the ban \u2014 which was scheduled to begin at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Thursday \u2014 asked judges to put it on hold while the courts decided its constitutionality. Department of Justice attorneys argued that the travel ban was necessary for national security and that it was well within the president\u2019s powers to restrict immigration to protect the nation. The aim, they said, was to screen out visitors from countries affected by terrorism until more stringent vetting measures could be put in place. Government lawyers said that the travel ban, a revised version of the Jan. 27 executive order that was blocked by federal courts, was modified enough to remove any legal concerns. Democratic state officials and civil rights groups cheered the Hawaii ruling. \u201cIt appeared the judge was not willing to buy the federal government\u2019s contention that they just need to stick to the neutral language\u201d on religion, said Chin, the Hawaii attorney general, at a news conference with Gov. David Ige. \u201cA win for Hawaii is a win for all of us,\u201d Washington state Atty. Gen. Bob Ferguson said outside the courthouse in Seattle where a judge heard two other challenges to the travel restrictions. \u201cTrump is piling up defeat after defeat after defeat. And we\u2019ll all be here working to make sure his streak continues.\u201d Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement the group welcomed the Hawaii decision as \u201cconfirmation of the strength of our nation's system of checks and balances.\u2026 We urge the Trump administration to scrap this Muslim ban entirely because it disrespects both the Constitution and America's longstanding tradition of religious freedom and inclusion.\" Trump is piling up defeat after defeat after defeat. And we\u2019ll all be here working to make sure his streak continues. \u2014 Bob Ferguson, Washington state attorney general His group has also sued over the travel restrictions in a separate case that is pending. The original order spurred tens of thousands of visa cancellations, chaos at U.S. international airports and dozens of lawsuits. That order stopped refugee resettlement from all countries for 120 days \u2014 and from Syria indefinitely \u2014 and banned citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 90 days while the government was to review its vetting procedures. A federal judge in Seattle halted that order in February after hearing arguments that it was discriminatory against Muslims and negatively impacted Washington state\u2019s universities, businesses and residents. His decision was upheld by a motions panel of three judges in the 9th Circuit.", "source": "chicagotribune", "publish_date": "2017-03-15", "authors": ["jaweed kaleem"], "type": "article", "id": 193, "author_string": "jaweed kaleem"}, {"title": "Hawaii says it will sue over Trump's new travel ban", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-hawaii-plans-to-become-first-state-to-1488940829-htmlstory.html", "text": "The state of Hawaii said in a court filing Tuesday that it intended to file a legal challenge to President's Trump's revamped executive order pausing refugee resettlement and immigration from six majority-Muslim countries. In a court filing in the state, Hawaii Atty. Gen.

The state said it would file a new complaint to supplement its initial challenge to an earlier, more comprehensive travel ban issued by the Trump administration in January. The intent of both travel orders, Trump administration officials say, is to screen out visitors from countries affected by terrorism until more stringent vetting measures can be put into place. In a second filing late Tuesday, Hawaii listed its reasons for challenging the new travel order. Hawaii says the new order has \"profound\" and \"detrimental\" effects on residents, businesses and universities. The state also argues that the executive order discriminates against Muslims and violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Constitution. The state's filing lists Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Assn. of Hawaii, as an example of a Hawaii resident affected by the travel order. Elshikh's mother-in-law is a national of Syria, a country listed in the new travel ban. The state also says his mosque members' relatives live in countries under the new ban and would not be able to visit family in Hawaii. The state's initial legal challenge to the president's first order on travel was filed Feb. 3 and was paused after a federal judge in Seattle blocked implementation of that order nationwide. Lawyers from Washington state who brought the Seattle case said Monday that they had not decided if they would sue over the new travel rules. In a separate filing Tuesday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Department of Justice moved to dismiss its appeal of the Seattle court's ruling on the first executive order. The new order has been stripped of many provisions which federal judges across the country found troublesome in the first one. Trump's new order does not give preference to religious minorities in refugee admissions. It exempts several categories of people from its restrictions, including dual nationals who have U.S. citizenship, green card holders and people who already hold valid visas. Legal experts have said the new travel ban, which applies to citizens of Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria and Yemen -- it does not include Iraq as the previous order did -- will be tougher to battle in court because of the president's broad authority over immigration enforcement and national security when it comes to non-citizens and those without visas.

Gen. Bob Ferguson said Thursday that the state would take President Trump to court to block enforcement of of his new, revamped travel order pausing refugee resettlement and travel from six majority-Muslim countries. Washington state's lawsuit against the first travel ban led a Seattle federal court judge to order a national halt to the executive order, which had caused chaos at airports around the country and led to the cancelation of 60,000 travel visas. At a news conference Thursday, Ferguson said he would file a motion asking the judge in the case, James Robart, to apply the restraining order against the old travel ban to the new one. Ferguson said the state's challenges to the new travel ban remain largely the same as the first one, which it said was discriminatory against Muslims and caused unnecessary harm to the state's residents, universities and businesses. Washington is joined by Minnesota in its lawsuit. The attorneys general of New York, Oregon and Massachusetts also said they would join the suit. The states follow Hawaii, which filed a complaint in a Honolulu federal court against the revised travel ban on Wednesday. Hawaii's complaint says it objects to the new travel order because it has \"profound\" and \"detrimental\" effects on the state's economy and people. The state also argues that the executive order discriminates against Muslims and violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Constitution. \u201c[W]hile the President signed a revised version on March 6... we still know exactly what it means. It is another attempt by the administration to enact a discriminatory ban that goes against the fundamental teachings of our Constitution and our immigration laws, even if it is cloaked in ostensibly neutral terms,\" the state says in its filing. The state's new complaint amends its initial challenge to an earlier, more comprehensive travel ban issued by the Trump administration in January.

The Department of Justice has argued in federal court filings this week that several court orders calling for a halt to the first ban do not apply to the new one.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017 Trump\u2019s assessment followed news of an explosion in a London subway car during the morning rush hour that injured at least 18 commuters and was labeled a terrorist attack by police. \u201cAnother attack in London by a loser terrorist,\u201d Trump said in early morning tweets. [Explosion in London subway declared \u2018terrorist incident\u2019 by police] \u201cThese are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!\u201d Trump added, referring to the police force in London. British police have arrested two men in connection with the homemade bomb that went off on the London subway and injured at least 30 people on Sept. 15. (Joyce Lee,Karla Adam/The Washington Post) It was unclear whether Trump had been briefed by his security advisers, and what information, if any, they provided about the identity of the assailants. Neither the Metropolitan Police nor the British government have said anything publicly beyond describing the detonation as a suspected terrorist attack. In a subsequent tweet, Trump said: \u201cLoser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner. The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a question about what information Trump used to craft his tweets. Asked about Trump\u2019s tweets during a television interview, British Prime Minister Theresa May said: \u201cI never think it\u2019s helpful for anyone to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.\u201d May\u2019s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, was more blunt in his criticism of Trump, writing on Twitter: \u201cTrue or not \u2014 and I'm sure he doesn't know \u2014 this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner.\u201d During a brief appearance in the Rose Garden on Friday, Trump called the attacks \u201ca terrible thing.\u201d \u201cIt keeps going and going, and we have to be very smart, and we have to be very, very tough \u2014 perhaps we\u2019re not nearly tough enough,\u201d he said. Trump said he had been briefed on the attack and told reporters he plans to call May. Trump's travel ban blocked the entry of citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. Officials have said the 90-day period will expire in less than two weeks, and Trump will face a critical decision about the ban's future. The Department of Homeland Security has been working on a report about countries that U.S. authorities say do not provide adequate information to vet their travelers. That report could inform a more expansive measure that bars people from coming to the United States. Trump's tweet seemed to envision such a \u201clarger, tougher\u201d ban, though he also said the measure needed to be \u201cmore specific\u201d \u2014 which might indicate the White House is not inclined to bar people merely because of their nationality. The Homeland Security report is expected to be presented to the White House in the coming weeks. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on whether the travel ban is legal on Oct. 10. But by that time, a critical portion of the directive will have expired, and a new measure might be in place. A person familiar with the ongoing discussions said a new ban might make the Supreme Court case moot, but could spark new legal challenges. A permanent ban, in particular, might be harder to defend in court, the person said. It is also possible, though unlikely, that Trump could merely let the ban expire. In a later tweet on Friday morning, Trump took credit for progress by his administration in combating the Islamic State terrorist group, asserting that more had been done in the past nine months than under Obama\u2019s eight years in office. \u201cMust be proactive & nasty!\u201d Trump wrote.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-09-15", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect and will consider case in fall", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-allows-limited-version-of-trumps-travel-ban-to-take-effect-will-consider-case-in-fall/2017/06/26/97afa314-573e-11e7-b38e-35fd8e0c288f_story.html", "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday permitted a scaled-back version of President Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries to take effect, deciding to hear the merits of the case in the fall but allowing Trump for now to claim a victory in the legal showdown. The court\u2019s unsigned order delivered a compromise neither side had asked for: It said the government may not bar those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as having family members here, or a job or a place in an American university. But the justices indicated that lower courts had gone too far in completely freezing Trump\u2019s order banning new visas for citizens of six countries \u2014 Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 for 90 days and putting the refu\u00adgee program on hold for 120 days. \u201cThe Government\u2019s interest in enforcing [the executive order], and the Executive\u2019s authority to do so, are undoubtedly at their peak when there is no tie between the foreign national and the United States,\u201d the court wrote. [What the Supreme Court\u2019s travel ban ruling means] Trump called the ruling \u201ca clear victory for our national security.\u201d In a statement, he said: \u201cAs president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive.\u201d He added that he was \u201cparticularly gratified that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was 9-0.\u201d The president said last week that the order would go into effect 72 hours after being approved by the courts. In the opinion, the court said it will hear arguments in the case \u2014 which raises fundamental questions about religious discrimination and the president\u2019s broad powers to protect the nation \u2014 when it reconvenes in October. In the meantime, the justices nudged the Trump administration to get on with what it said would be a temporary pause to review vetting procedures. \u201cWe fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments\u201d within 90 days, the court said. That means that by the time the court takes up the case in the fall, circumstances could be quite different. Depending on the results of the review, Trump could push to extend the measure or even make it permanent. A group of Muslim protesters gathers during a rally against the travel ban at San Diego International Airport on March 6. (Sandy Huffaker/AFP/Getty Images) The court also told lawyers to address whether the justices\u2019 consideration of the case in the fall might be moot, because administration officials will have had time to review vetting procedures. Leon Fresco, who served as deputy assistant attorney general for the office of immigration litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department, said the limited travel ban seems to affect two types of people who don\u2019t necessarily have ties to the United States: those seeking U.S. visas as visitors and those trying to get visas through a government lottery meant for people from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States. The State Department would not say how many visa seekers the ban would affect. Anyone with a school acceptance letter, job offer or family member already here would probably be able to obtain a visa and travel as normal. Interpretations of the court\u2019s decision diverged widely among immigration lawyers and advocates. Some, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, suggested that the decision would allow for \u201conly the narrowest\u201d implementation of the travel ban, affecting very few would-be travelers from the six countries. But other groups, such as Amnesty International USA, warned of grave consequences, such as a renewal of \u201cchaos\u201d at airports and an enforcement of the ban that would \u201ctear families apart.\u201d [Federal appeals court says Trump travel ban violates Constitution] Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch would have let the ban take effect as the Trump administration crafted it, and Thomas wrote that the court had made an \u201cimplicit conclusion that the Government has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d The court\u2019s revised order will \u201cburden executive officials with the task of deciding \u2014 on peril of contempt \u2014 whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,\u201d Thomas wrote. Such a compromise, he wrote, will lead to a \u201cflood of litigation\u201d over what constitutes a \u201cbona fide relationship.\u201d The travel ban has been a major point of contention between Trump and civil rights groups, which say it is motivated by unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims. Trump contends that the ban is necessary to protect the nation while the administration decides whether tougher vetting procedures and other measures are needed. He has railed against federal judges who have blocked the move. Because the executive order was stopped by lower courts, travelers from those countries have been entering the United States following normal visa procedures. Trump initially moved to implement the restrictions in January, in his first week in office. [Analysis: Trump travel ban wouldn\u2019t have kept out anyone behind deadly terrorist attacks] His first executive order went into effect immediately and resulted in chaos at airports in the United States and abroad as travelers from the targeted nations were stranded or sent back to their countries. Lawyers for challengers to the order rushed to federal courts, and the order was stayed within days. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit eventually said the order could not be implemented, infuriating the president, who said he would take the case to the Supreme Court. Instead, his administration regrouped and issued a second order in March. It added a section detailing national security concerns, removed Iraq from the list of countries affected, deleted a section that had targeted Syrian refugees and removed a provision that favored Christian immigrants. Trump\u2019s lawyers told courts that the new order was written to respond to the 9th Circuit\u2019s concerns. But new lawsuits were immediately filed, and federal judges once again stopped the implementation. A federal district judge in Maryland blocked the portion of the order affecting travelers from the six countries. A judge in Hawaii also froze that portion, as well as the part affecting refu\u00adgee programs. Appeals courts on both coasts upheld those decisions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond agreed with U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang in Maryland, who sided with opponents in finding that the ban violates the Constitution by intentionally discriminating against Muslims. In a 10-to-3 decision, the appeals court noted Trump\u2019s remarks before and after his election about a ban on Muslims and said the executive order \u201cin context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\u201d Meanwhile, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit said Trump had not adhered to federal law under which Congress gives the president broad power in immigration matters. They said that national security is not a \u201c \u2018talismanic incantation\u2019 that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power.\u201d In both appeals courts, a minority of conservative judges said their colleagues were making a mistake. Judges should consider only whether the executive orders were proper on their face, they said, without trying to decide whether the president had ulterior motives, and should defer to national security decisions made by the executive branch. \u201cThe Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds,\u201d wrote dissenting 4th Circuit Judge Paul V. Niemeyer. Justice, Homeland Security and State department officials said they were still studying the decision to determine exactly who it affects and how it might be carried out. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion seems unlikely to re-create the chaos that ensued after Trump issued his first travel ban, causing tens of thousands of visas to be revoked and some travelers to be detained and sent away from U.S. airports. Trump already had rescinded and revised his first order so that it affected only the issuance of new visas, and the justices left intact an even more limited version. Advocates nonetheless said they would deploy people to watch for potential abuses. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the U.S.: people with urgent medical conditions blocked, innocent people left adrift, all of whom have been extensively vetted,\u201d said former British foreign secretary David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee. After Monday\u2019s court ruling, Trump issued his low-key statement through normal White House channels. That was in contrast to his thunderous Twitter offerings when courts previously disagreed with him. He wrote in one such post: \u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d Abigail Hauslohner and Ann E.

(Brian Snyder/Reuters) Department of Homeland Security officials plan soon to submit to the White House a report that is likely to shape the future of President Trump\u2019s entry ban, a key portion of which is set to expire Sept. 24, authorities said. The report is critical because it is being prepared in response to Trump\u2019s order that the homeland security secretary present him with a list of countries for inclusion in what effectively amounts to a more permanent ban. And because of impending deadlines, the White House will probably have to take action even before the Supreme Court hears arguments next month on whether the entry ban is at its core legal. [Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect and will consider case in fall] The White House has several options \u2014 including extending the current ban, modifying it or letting it lapse. The matter now sits in the hands of the Department of Homeland Security, which has been tasked with assessing the type of information that other countries provide so American officials can vet travelers wanting to come to the United States. When Trump signed his revised entry ban in March, it was billed as a temporary measure, necessary to reduce officials\u2019 workload so they could review what information they were getting to vet people coming into the country. The executive order barred citizens of six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days and banned refugees from all countries from entering for 120 days. Unlike a similar travel ban signed in January, the order exempted current visa holders and spelled out ways people might apply for a waiver. The ban also established the cap on refugees for fiscal 2017 at 50,000, and officials at the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House have been discussing possibly lowering the limit for fiscal 2018, a level not seen in decades, according to a person familiar with the discussions. No final decision has been made, though, and the matter is ultimately up to the White House. The discussions were first reported by the New York Times. The new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. [U.S. surpasses Trump administration\u2019s cap on refugee admissions] In March, with certain travelers prevented from entering, Trump commanded the Department of Homeland Security to conduct \u2014 within 20 days \u2014 a \u201cworldwide review\u201d of the information needed to vet travelers from other countries, and to come up with a list of those that did not provide adequate data. Those countries were then to be given 50 days to start providing the information or come up with a plan to provide it. Those that didn\u2019t would risk being included in a presidential proclamation that would bar the entry of at least certain categories of their citizens, according to the executive order. David Lapan, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, said the department delivered a report to the White House in early July on the results of its worldwide review and now was working on the report about countries that could not provide adequate information. Lapan said officials had \u201ca comprehensive understanding of the information we receive from all foreign partners\u201d and would \u201cprovide a report to the President in the coming weeks.\u201d A State Department spokeswoman said that agency was \u201cengaging with foreign governments in order to meet these new standards for information sharing.\u201d She said she could not \u201cprejudge the outcome of this engagement.\u201d A person familiar with discussions over the entry ban said it is possible Homeland Security\u2019s report \u2014 and what the White House decides to do with it \u2014 could have a significant impact on the legal wrangling surrounding the measure. If the ban were to lapse or be changed significantly, that could render the upcoming Supreme Court hearing on the matter moot, or it could spawn fresh legal challenges, the person said. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because discussions are ongoing, said that it seemed unlikely the White House would abandon the ban entirely but that establishing a permanent ban could make it harder to defend in court. The White House declined to comment on what it was considering. Although Trump signed the travel ban in March, it was waylaid by court challenges before it could take effect, and the president issued a memo effectively declaring that the 90- and 120-day clocks wouldn\u2019t start running until the court-imposed blockades were lifted. On June 26, though, the Supreme Court permitted a limited version of the measure to take hold \u2014 although it said the government could not bar those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as having family members here, or a job or a place in an American university. U.S. officials formally implemented the directive three days later. Spokesmen for the Justice and Homeland Security departments said this week that they consider the clocks to have started running when the Supreme Court ruled. That means the ban on citizens from the six countries will expire Sept. 24, and the ban on refugees will expire Oct. 24. On Oct. 10, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on whether the ban is legal. That probably means by the time the court issues a decision, the entry ban on refugees and citizens of six countries will have expired. As it stands now, the administration is allowed to implement a version of the ban that is far less forceful than it had hoped. After the Supreme Court ruled in the White House\u2019s favor in June, officials initially tried to block even grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States from entering \u2014 although a federal district judge ultimately stopped them from doing so, and the Supreme Court left that decision undisturbed. The Supreme Court on Tuesday, though, put on hold another portion of the district judge\u2019s ruling, which would have prevented the administration from banning refugees with formal assurances from resettlement agencies. That means the government can keep out a pool of about 24,000 refugees, despite the assertion by those suing over the ban that they had a bona fide connection to the United States and thus should be allowed in.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-09-13", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Trump\u2019s travel ban: What happens next?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/02/06/trumps-travel-ban-what-happens-next/", "text": " Thousands gather at a Denver park on Feb. 4 for a rally to support the Muslim community and to protest President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning the U.S. entry of some refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries.

The suspension means people who were previously banned will have more time to reach the United States. Trump\u2019s executive order called for temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority counties from entering the United States. [Opposition to Trump travel ban grows as key court decision looms] On Sunday, two appeals court judges on the West Coast declined to immediately restore the ban, but they asked to hear more arguments. The states of Washington and Minnesota, which are suing over it, made their case early Monday. The Justice Department has to answer by 6 p.m. Monday. What happens next? The appeals court will likely make one of three decisions: Restore the ban, keep it suspended, or schedule a further hearing. Several federal judges have already struck down aspects of the ban, but the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is much broader and more significant. That is because the judges there are considering whether it should be halted entirely, as opposed to just for particular people or those who already have made it to U.S. airports. How can a U.S. district judge\u2019s decision affect the entire country? As the name implies, U.S. district judges are federal, appointed by the president, and their decisions can have nationwide repercussions. A federal judge in Texas similarly blocked former president Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration. What does the lawsuit say? The lawsuit alleges the immigration order was \u201cseparating families, harming thousands of the states\u2019 residents, damaging the states\u2019 economies, hurting state-based companies, and undermining both states\u2019 sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees.\u201d What if the court sides with the White House? If Trump\u2019s ban were to be immediately reinstated, that might spark chaos similar to what occurred when it was first rolled out. Hundreds of people were detained by customs officers at U.S. airports, and some were deported. The actions sparked protests and other lawsuits across the country. It was unclear whether U.S. officials had a plan to avoid a repeat of that scenario, though much would depend on what specifically was ordered by a court and when. What can either side do if it loses? Either side could request Supreme Court intervention, though it would take the votes of five justices to overturn the panel decision. The court has been shorthanded since the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, and it is ideologically divided between four more liberal justices and four conservative-leaning ones. The Supreme Court could become involved as soon as this week, if either side challenges the ruling of the appellate court. What do legal experts say? Legal analysts have said that the president has broad authority to set immigration policy. But civil liberties advocates counter that the executive order essentially amounts to a discriminatory ban on Muslims that has no real national security purpose. What has the White House said? The Trump administration has been steadfast in its support of the executive order, which it says is necessary for national security. Trump tweeted multiple times his disdain for the federal judge in Washington state who put a stop to it. The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J.

The enforcement of the order is entirely suspended for now, and people who have been stranded have rushed to fly back to the United States. The State Department also restored visas that were previously revoked. Some successfully reunited with family members, while others \u2014 particularly those whose visas were physically taken or marked as invalid \u2014 ran into roadblocks trying to board planes overseas. Immigration advocates are encouraging people who qualify for entry to board planes as soon as possible.

Justice Department lawyers asked the court to overturn a decision of the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit that kept in place a freeze on President Trump\u2019s revised ban. [Appeals court rules against Trump travel ban] The 10-to-3 ruling last week was one in a series of legal defeats for the administration, as judges across the country have said Trump\u2019s claim of protecting the nation was cover for making good on a campaign promise to ban Muslims from entry into the United States. The government\u2019s filing late Thursday asks the justices to set aside the 4th Circuit ruling and accept the case for oral arguments. It also asks the high court to lift an even broader nationwide injunction issued by a federal judge in a separate Hawaii case. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which covers Hawaii, heard the government\u2019s arguments in that case last month, but has not yet ruled. In turning to the high court, Justice Department lawyers said the 4th Circuit should have considered only the language of the executive order and not second-guessed the president\u2019s motivations. [Court says essentially that Trump is not to be believed. Will Supreme Court conclude the same?] The Supreme Court \u201chas never invalidated religion-neutral government action based on speculation about officials\u2019 subjective motivations drawn from \u00adcampaign-trail statements by a political candidate,\u201d Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall wrote in the government\u2019s lawyers wrote in their filing. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Thursday that the administration is \u201cconfident that President Trump\u2019s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism.\u201d Omar Jadwat, who is director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project and argued the 4th Circuit case, said the Supreme Court should not grant the government\u2019s request. \u201cThere is no reason to disturb the Fourth Circuit\u2019s ruling, which was supported by an overwhelming majority of the judges on the full court, is consistent with rulings from other courts across the nation, and enforces a fundamental principle that protects all of us from government condemnation of our religious beliefs,\u201d Jadwat said in a statement. The government would need the votes of five of the justices of the court, now returned to full strength following the confirmation of Trump\u2019s nominee, Neil M. Gorsuch. But the timing of the case is tricky: The process of briefing, arguing and deciding a case at the Supreme Court takes months. The justices are scheduled to end their work at the end of June. And the ban, if it is allowed to be enforced, is proposed as temporary, just to give the government 90 days to study and implement new vetting procedures. It imposes a 120-day halt to the nation\u2019s refu\u00adgee process. The 4th Circuit decision covers only the entry program. The Hawaii order covers both, and Wall said at oral arguments in the 4th Circuit case that the order has prevented the government from moving forward on those objectives. The Supreme Court on Friday told the travel ban\u2019s challengers to respond to the government\u2019s filing by June 12. If the Supreme Court stayed one or both of the injunctions, the executive order could expire before the court was able to hear oral arguments in the fall. In the filing Thursday, Wall said it was critical for the court to affirm the president\u2019s broad authority when it comes to immigration. \u201cThe precedent set by this case for the judiciary\u2019s proper role in reviewing the president\u2019s \u00adnational-security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this order, and this constitutional moment,\u201d the filing said. \u201cThe decision below departs from those rules, and calls into question the Executive and his authority in a way that warrants this Court\u2019s review.\u201d The president\u2019s travel order has been one of the most controversial of the Trump administration, as the first entry ban created chaos at airports around the world and prompted major protests here and abroad. Trump has denounced judicial decisions freezing the ban as unprecedented assaults on his power to fulfill his most important role, keeping the nation safe. [Appeals court says president not to be believed. Will Supreme Court agree?] Trump on Jan. 27, just a week after inauguration, issued the first travel ban executive order. It barred the entry of citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen), ordered a temporary halt to refu\u00adgee arrivals and would have eventually given preference to those who were religious minorities in their countries, such as Christians. Several judges and a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit shut it down. Trump vowed to go to the Supreme Court that time, too, but eventually issued a new order. That order, the subject of the 4th Circuit ruling, removed Iraq from the list, deleted references to religion and added national security rationales for the policy. [Trump issues revised travel ban] But it was stopped by federal district judges in Maryland and Hawaii. In the 4th Circuit, which covers Maryland, six judges agreed in full with an opinion by Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory that the national security rationale advanced by the president was simply pretext for unlawful animosity toward Muslims and an attempt to make good on a campaign promise to bar Muslims from entry into the country. He cited Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric and statements made when he signed the executive orders and said courts had an obligation to look beyond their seemingly neutral language. The order \u201cspeaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination,\u201d Gregory wrote. [There\u2019s a word that no longer describes the federal appeals court in Richmond] At the 4th Circuit, two of the judges agreed with the majority that the order probably violates the constitutional command that government not favor or disparage one religion over another. But they also said the order was not justified under the power that Congress gives the president by law. That broad power says that \u201cwhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens . . . would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may . . . suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants.\u201d Congress later added, though that \u201cno person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\u201d Judge Barbara Milano Keenan said that Trump had made no finding that the citizens of the six countries provided a specific threat to the United States. And Judge James A. Wynn Jr. said Congress did not give the president power to take action based on \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d All of the judges ruling against Trump were nominated to the appeals court by Democratic presidents. The three dissenting judges were nominated by Republicans and said their colleagues had wandered into uncharted territory by relying on campaign statements to find an Establishment Clause violation. \u201cThe Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds \u2014 one that transforms the majority\u2019s criticisms of a candidate\u2019s various campaign statements into a constitutional violation,\u201d wrote Judge Paul V. Niemeyer.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-06-01", "authors": ["robert.barnes.3139"], "type": "article", "author_string": "robert barnes"}, {"title": "Administration says Supreme Court should stop review of past travel bans", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/administration-says-supreme-court-should-stop-review-of-past-travel-bans/2017/10/05/f5d07c68-a9e4-11e7-b3aa-c0e2e1d41e38_story.html", "text": "People wait in line to attend the fall session of the Supreme Court, on Oct. 2, 2017, in Washington. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) The Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Thursday that there is no reason for the court to rule on the legality of the president\u2019s previous ban on travel from certain countries and that lower-court rulings against the president\u2019s position should be erased. Opponents of the ban, who had persuaded two appeals courts to block the executive order, said the court should continue to review the cases. Even if not, they said, the lower-court rulings should stand. The justices asked for the new briefing about whether the issue was moot since President Trump announced a replacement travel ban last month. The court canceled an oral argument on the issue scheduled for next week. [White House announces expanded travel ban] The cases raise complicated and far-reaching issues about the president\u2019s powers, and many legal experts believe the court may not want to jump in unless it is necessary. It is unclear when the court will rule on whether to proceed. Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said the new proclamation means that temporary measures under review at the Supreme Court have been superseded. \u201cIf this court were to continue to hear these appeals, it would be asked to decide questions with no ongoing practical import,\u201d Francisco wrote. He also said two rulings that went against Trump \u2014 by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u2014 should be vacated. \u201cIf allowed to stand, the lower courts\u2019 decisions threaten to undermine the executive\u2019s ability to deal with sensitive foreign-policy issues in strategically important regions of the world,\u201d Francisco wrote. The previous order was challenged by the state of Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union as an illegal ban on Muslims. Hawaii and the ACLU were representing those with family members affected by the ban. [ACLU to challenge Trump\u2019s latest travel ban] \u201cThe 90-day ban on their relatives has now been converted into an indefinite ban with the potential to separate their families, and thousands of others\u2019, for years,\u201d wrote ACLU lawyer Omar C. Jadwat, asking the court to keep the cases alive. \u201cAnd the religious condemnation of the earlier Executive Order is not dissipated by [the new one], which \u2014 despite some new window dressing \u2014 continues to relay a message of disparagement to the plaintiffs and other members of their faith.\u201d But both the ACLU\u2019s submission and the one from Hawaii seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the court would pass on reviewing the old executive orders. \u201cThe court will soon have another opportunity to determine the legality of the President\u2019s actions in the context of the new order\u201d because legal challenges to it are underway, wrote Washington attorney Neal K. Katyal, representing Hawaii. A federal judge in Maryland said this week that those suing over the previous travel ban could amend their complaint and file a request for a preliminary injunction to block the new one. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Oct. 17. But both challengers said it would be unfair to wipe out lower court decisions because of the government\u2019s actions. \u201cAny mootness would be entirely the consequence of the government\u2019s voluntary actions \u2014 in managing the timing of the bans, in declining to seek a swift hearing on the merits, and in rebottling its old ban in a new order,\u201d Katyal wrote. \u201cIt would be profoundly inequitable to permit the government to use these maneuvers to obtain the very relief it sought on the merits: vacatur of the injunctions,\u201d he wrote. [The puzzling inclusion of Chad in Trump\u2019s new travel ban] The latest travel ban could block the issuance of tens of thousands of visas each year to people who want to immigrate to the United States or to come on business or as tourists, according to a Washington Post review of State Department data. In some ways it is more expansive than the second executive order it replaced \u2014 remaining in effect indefinitely and imposing restrictions on eight, rather than six, countries. But unlike the previous ban, the restrictions vary from place to place, and countries that increase their cooperation and information-sharing with the United States might be able to find their way off the list. The proclamation was issued after a lengthy process in which U.S. officials reviewed vetting procedures and sought information from countries around the world. Those that were either unwilling or unable to produce the data the United States wanted ended up on the banned list. For Syria and North Korea, the president\u2019s proclamation blocks immigrants wanting to relocate to the United States and nonimmigrants wishing to visit in some capacity. For Iran, the proclamation blocks both immigrants and nonimmigrants, although it exempts students and those participating in a cultural exchange. The proclamation blocks people from Chad, Libya and Yemen from coming to the United States as immigrants or on business or tourist visas, and it blocks people from Somalia from coming as immigrants. It names Venezuela, but it blocks only certain government officials and their families. Sudan, which was covered by the previous ban, was removed from the list.

The court\u2019s terse order means the administration cannot impose a blanket prohibition on people from those countries who have grandparents, aunts, uncles and other relatives in the United States. The Trump administration has advanced a stricter interpretation of what kind of family relationships could entitle a person to receive a U.S. visa, but a lower court in Hawaii ruled that the criteria were too tight. The Supreme Court\u2019s action on Wednesday had two parts. In one, the justices said they will not disturb the lower court\u2019s decision that expanded the definition of close family ties. But in another, the justices granted the government\u2019s request to put on hold a part of the lower court\u2019s order that would have made it easier for more refugees to enter the country. That order could have granted entry to about 24,000 refugees who were already working with resettlement agencies. Wednesday\u2019s unsigned, one-paragraph order gave no reasoning for the Supreme Court\u2019s action. Three justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 said they would have granted the administration\u2019s request to put the entire order on hold. The majority said the government\u2019s appeal of the lower court\u2019s ruling should go through normal channels, with the next stop at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The Justice Department reacted to the action only by saying it \u201clooks forward to presenting its arguments to the 9th Circuit.\u201d Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said in a statement that the court\u2019s action \u201cconfirms we were right to say that the Trump Administration over-reached in trying to unilaterally keep families apart from each other.\u201d The National Immigration Law Center said in a news release that although \u201cfamily unity won today,\u201d it will continue to litigate \u201cto ensure that refugees can find the shelter they were offered by settlement agencies in the United States.\u201d The court\u2019s decision was the latest development in the Trump administration\u2019s nearly six-month effort to temporarily shut down the nation\u2019s refu\u00adgee program and bar visitors from several majority-Muslim countries while officials examine vetting procedures. [Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump travel ban] The Trump administration has said the effort was needed to protect the country. Challengers have fought the ban as an unconstitutional effort at keeping out Muslims, a policy that Trump had advocated during the presidential campaign. The latest version of the ban bars visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. These restrictions and the refu\u00adgee ban had been put on hold by lower courts. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on the merits of the challenge to the administration\u2019s travel ban on Oct. 10. In the meantime, the court said last month that the ban could go into effect and be applied to those without connections to the United States but that foreigners with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States must be exempted from the ban. The justices did not define such a relationship but gave examples of what would qualify for the exemption: a close relative in the United States, a place in an American university, a job offer or speaking engagement. The Trump administration interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s requirement of a \u201cclose familial relationship\u201d to be a parent, spouse, fiance, son or daughter, sibling, son-in-law or daughter-in-law in the United States. The government would continue to bar refugees who had offers from refu\u00adgee resettlement programs. The challengers went back to U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson of Hawaii, who had earlier issued a nationwide injunction against the ban. Watson ruled last week that the government\u2019s \u201cnarrowly defined list\u201d of exemptions was not supported by either the Supreme Court decision or by the law. [Judge rules Trump administration too restrictive in travel ban implementation] \u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cIndeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The government\u2019s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.\u201d He extended the exemptions to include those with grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. Watson wrote that refugees with assurances from resettlement agencies are also exempt from the ban. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to stay Watson\u2019s ruling. Watson\u2019s interpretation of what kinds of family relationships qualify \u201cempties the court\u2019s decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just \u2018close\u2019 family members, but virtually all family members,\u201d the administration said in its brief to the court. \u201cTreating all of these relationships as \u2018close familial relationships\u2019 reads the term \u2018close\u2019 out of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d The administration added that Watson\u2019s ruling would cover virtually all refugees. The state of Hawaii, which has been a leader in the challenge to the travel ban, told the justices that the government\u2019s argument was \u201cnonsense.\u201d Any rule that maintained that grandparents are not close familial relations was suspect as applied both to those who sought visas and to refugees, the state said in its brief to the court. \u201cThat argument is as wrong as it sounds, and nothing in this court\u2019s opinion, the immigration laws, or common sense supports it,\u201d the state wrote.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-07-19", "authors": ["robert.barnes.3139"], "type": "article", "author_string": "robert barnes"}, {"title": "Federal appeals court rules 3 to 0 against Trump on travel ban", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/federal-appeals-court-maintains-suspension-of-trumps-immigration-order/2017/02/09/e8526e70-ed47-11e6-9662-6eedf1627882_story.html", "text": "A federal appeals panel has maintained the freeze on President Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order, meaning previously barred refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries can continue entering the United States.

But their ruling is undeniably a blow to the government and means the travel ban will remain off for the foreseeable future. (Reuters) Trump reacted angrily on Twitter, posting just minutes after the ruling, \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d He later said to reporters that the judges had made \u201ca political decision.\u201d \u201cWe have a situation where the security of our country is at stake, and it\u2019s a very, very serious situation, so we look forward, as I just said, to seeing them in court,\u201d he said. On Friday, Trump continued to take aim at the ruling. He posted on Twitter a quote from a Lawfare article, which noted the judges had not cited in their opinion the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the president broad powers to stop foreigners from entering the United States. What Trump failed to note is the article\u2019s author said he felt the court\u2019s decision was \u201ccorrect \u2026 for the simple reason that there is no cause to plunge the country into turmoil again while the courts address the merits of these matters over the next few weeks.\u201d The judges, too, noted they \u201cowe considerable deference to the President\u2019s policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security,\u201d and their decision \u2014 for now \u2014 was limited to whether the government had an immediate need to put the ban back in place. The Justice Department, the Lawfare piece added, had \u201csubmitted no evidence to rebut the States\u2019 argument that the district court\u2019s order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years,\u201d adding that the government \u201cmay yet pursue and vindicate its interests in the full course of this litigation.\u201d The Justice Department, which was defending the administration\u2019s position, said in a statement it was \u201creviewing the decision and considering its options.\u201d Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had sued over the ban, said, \u201cBottom line, this is a complete victory for the state of Washington,\u201d and declared that the judges\u2019 ruling \u201ceffectively granted everything we sought.\u201d [Read the 9th Circuit\u2019s opinion on the travel ban] The Justice Department could now ask the Supreme Court \u2014 which often defers to the president on matters of immigration and national security \u2014 to intervene. The Supreme Court, though, remains one justice short, and many see it as ideologically split 4 to 4. A tie would keep in place whatever the appeals court decides. The Justice Department could also ask the full 9th Circuit to consider the matter. The appeals court opinion was written by Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama; Judge Richard R. Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge William C. Canby, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter. It was detailed, but it does not represent a final judgment on Trump\u2019s immigration ban. Last Friday, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart granted the states of Washington and Minnesota a temporary restraining order on the ban. The appeals court judges noted their ruling was a \u201cpreliminary one,\u201d and they were deciding only whether the government had \u201cmade a strong showing of its likely success\u201d in getting the restraining order thrown out. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said on Fox News: \u201cThis ruling does not affect the merits at all. It is an interim ruling, and we\u2019re fully confident now that we\u2019ll get our day in court and have an opportunity to argue this on the merits, that we\u2019ll prevail.\u201d The ruling, though, is critically important \u2014 as Trump\u2019s ban on refugees lasts only 120 days, and his ban on visitors from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen lasts only 90 days. The judges also said that while the states of Washington and Minnesota had made serious allegations \u2014 and the impact of the order was \u201cimmediate and widespread\u201d \u2014 the government had not pointed to any substantive evidence to support its need for the ban. \u201cThe Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cRather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all.\u201d [Travelers from Iran board flights to the United States following stay, attorney says] The states have alleged that the executive order harms their businesses and universities, preventing some students and faculty from traveling abroad for fear of being stranded and diminishing the sales tax revenue they receive. Legislators and others who had opposed the ban hailed the judges\u2019 ruling and urged Trump to back down. \u201cPresident Trump ought to see the handwriting on the wall that his executive order is unconstitutional,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cHe should abandon this proposal, roll up his sleeves and come up with a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe.\u201d Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said, \u201cIf the President were serious about bringing our country together and keeping us safe, he would rescind this arbitrary and discriminatory order and recall what makes our country great.\u201d Hillary Clinton, who lost the presidency to Trump in November, posted on Twitter simply, \u201c3-0.\u201d Federal immigration law undeniably gives the president broad authority to bar people from coming into the United States, stating that if the president finds \u201cthe entry of any aliens\u201d would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the country\u2019s interests, he can impose restrictions. But lawsuits across the country have alleged that Trump\u2019s particular order ran afoul of the Constitution in that it intentionally discriminated against Muslims. At a hearing Tuesday, Justice Department lawyer August Flentje vigorously disputed that the measure was intended to target Muslims. In their ruling, the judges did not reveal their opinion on that question, although they noted Washington and Minnesota had \u201coffered evidence of numerous statements by the President about his intent to implement a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 as well as evidence they claim suggests that the Executive Order was intended to be that ban.\u201d Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani recently said publicly: \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said: \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d On the campaign trail, Trump himself called for a \u201ccomplete and total shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the country. The appeals court judges had questioned both sides skeptically at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, seeming particularly interested in what evidence Trump relied upon in implementing his order and what limits the Justice Department saw on the president\u2019s authority to set immigration policy. While Flentje urged them to restore the measure completely, he also at one point offered a fallback position. The judges, he suggested, could limit Robart\u2019s order so that it applied only to foreigners previously admitted to the country who were abroad now or those who wished to travel and return to the United States in the future. [Trump decries \u2018disgraceful\u2019 opposition as appeals court weighs immigration order] They declined to do even that, saying, as written, the president\u2019s executive order could apply even to green-card holders \u2014 which it once seemed to do, although the White House counsel later issued guidance saying it did not. The judges said the Justice Department had \u201coffered no authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the Executive Order,\u201d and \u201cin light of the Government\u2019s shifting interpretations of the Executive Order,\u201d they were not convinced that guidance would hold. Trump and his supporters have pressed the case that the short-term stoppage on refugees and immigrants from the seven countries is necessary for national security reasons, and they have leveled blunt criticism at the courts. Trump went so far as to suggest on Twitter that if an attack were to happen, the judiciary would be to blame. On Wednesday, he denounced arguments about his order as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and said \u201ca bad high school student\u201d would understand the broad authority the law gives him to impose immigration restrictions. A day earlier, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told Congress that he thought judges might be considering the issue from an \u201cacademic\u201d perspective instead of the national security lens through which he views the world. [Trump lashes out at \u2018so-called judge\u2019 who temporarily blocked entry ban] \u201cOf course, in their courtrooms, they\u2019re protected by people like me,\u201d Kelly said. Federal courts in New York, California and elsewhere already had blocked aspects of the ban from being implemented, although one federal judge in Massachusetts declared that he did not think that challengers had demonstrated that they had a high likelihood of success. The case before the 9th Circuit, though, was much broader than the others, because it stemmed from a federal judge\u2019s outright halting of the ban.

A federal judge in New York blocked deportations nationwide late Saturday of those detained on entry to the United States. (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) President Trump's executive order to immediately deny entry to the United States to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries has led to impassioned demonstrations at airports, international denunciations and even criticism from some fellow Republicans. It has also suffered two early defeats in the courts, after judges in New York and Virginia late Saturday blocked the deportations of those denied entry. The Post's team has all the details here: Trump\u2019s order reverberated across the world Saturday, making it increasingly clear that the measure he had promised during his presidential campaign was casting a wider net than even his opponents had feared. Confusion and concern among immigrant advocates mounted throughout the day as travelers from the Middle East were detained at U.S. airports or sent home. A lawsuit filed on behalf of two Iraqi men challenged Trump\u2019s executive action, which was signed Friday and initially cast as applying to refugees and migrants. But as the day progressed, administration officials confirmed that the sweeping order also targeted U.S. legal residents from the named countries \u2014 green-card holders \u2014 who were abroad when it was signed. Also subject to being barred entry into the United States are dual nationals, or people born in one of the seven countries who hold passports even from U.S. allies, such as the United Kingdom. The virtually unprecedented measures triggered harsh reactions from not only Democrats and others who typically advocate for immigrants but also key sectors of the U.S. business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticized the president. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Lawyers and advocates for immigrants are advising them to seek asylum in Canada. With any other president, it would seem that the law of unintended consequences had begun to apply and that perhaps we might see a softening of the policy. The targeting of green-card holders \u2014 those previously legally allowed to be in the United States who suddenly find themselves in limbo \u2014 in particular seems to have caught everyone off guard. But Trump isn't your average president. And his rhetoric on this issue has made clear he's likely to view the backlash and anecdotes of stranded travelers as merely the cost of doing business \u2014 a perhaps unfortunate side effect of keeping the country safe. We shouldn't expect any kind of hasty retreat, barring more successful legal challenges. A case in point is the response in the wee hours of Sunday morning from the Department of Homeland Security. In a statement, it suggested the whole thing has been overblown, declaring that \u201cless than one percent\u201d of international travelers were \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by the executive order. That choice of words says plenty. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive orders remain in place \u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\u201d the statement said. Trump himself assured reporters Saturday afternoon, \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely,\u201d adding: \u201cWe were totally prepared.\u201d Trump also tweeted Sunday: Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 Meanwhile, his aides are reportedly saying behind close doors that all is well. sources: WH policy director Stephen Miller told govt employees Sat. that the public is behind the Exec Order, ignore hysterical voices on TV \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 29, 2017 Those reactions say a lot about how firm Trump and his team will be on this. Trump's proposal to deny entry to the United States \u2014 initially to cover all Muslims, and then those from terrorism-prone countries (which are predominantly Muslim) -- shifted over the course of his campaign and transition effort, so we weren't sure exactly what we would be getting when he finally put it into practice as president. But the constant was that it would be somewhat, well, extreme. He even called for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants and refugees. Trump didn't apologize for this; he cited the need to keep the country safe from terrorism, at whatever cost. Trump administration officials defended the president's executive order temporarily banning entry to the U.S. from seven mostly Muslim countries, but lawmakers from both parties expressed strong concern or objection. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Opponents point to the lack of instances of terrorism committed by refugees or foreign nationals from the countries Trump isolated. They also note countries such as Saudi Arabia aren't included, despite the fact that most of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers were Saudi citizens. But there's no real way to measure the terrorism that these measures will prevent \u2014 if any. And given Trump's belief in sensationalized numbers when it comes to violence and crime in this country, it seems likely he'll believe he's thwarting plenty of very bad things. The specter of terrorist attacks, violence and \u201ccarnage\u201d has always loomed large in Trump's rhetoric. And in our president, we have someone who isn't afraid of a black-and-white, us-vs.-them policy toward Islam and fighting terrorism. Trump ran an unapologetically nationalistic, \u201cAmerica First\u201d campaign \u2014 rhetoric that he turned up to 11 in his inaugural address. Against that backdrop, the idea that foreigners and/or Muslims are being unfairly targeted by this Trump policy isn't one that's likely to weigh heavily on him.

With that in mind, I present the White House's gloating after the Supreme Court partially reinstated its travel ban on Monday. this one is delicious though. pic.twitter.com/rhOkZA0HBg \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) June 26, 2017 \u201cIt\u2019s a huge win for the president and the executive order,\u201d Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said on Fox Business Network shortly after the ruling. Some conservative writers also hailed this as a win for Trump. David French of the (not exactly Trump-friendly) National Review wrote: \u201cVictory for Trump: SCOTUS Restores Vast Majority of Travel Ban.\u201d This is what you might call the soft bigotry of low expectations. Yes, the Supreme Court allowed for part of the White House's travel ban to go into effect after some judges had put the whole thing on hold. But if this is what passes for a big Trump win, it's going to be a long four years for him. For a few reasons: 1) This wouldn't really be seen as a \u201cwin\u201d unless other judges hadn't halted the ban in the first place. If the lower courts had upheld the ban and this had been appealed to the Supreme Court by the other side, the narrative today would be that the Supreme Court just put part of Trump's travel ban on hold. It's also not altogether surprising that the more left-leaning 9th Circuit Court of Appeals would go further in halting the ban than the Supreme Court would. And the sum total is still that part of Trump's ban remains blocked, with no ruling on the overall constitutionality and the possibility that it gets partially struck down for good. President Trump's travel ban has been challenged in court at every turn. Now the Supreme Court is allowing a limited version to take effect, but with an expanded list of familial exemptions. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) 2) We are simply talking about whether Trump overstepped his constitutional bounds with the travel ban executive order \u2014 a very low bar \u2014 and not whether the broader policy is successful or popular. And in fact, a recent poll showed Americans oppose the ban 52-43. 3) The degree to which the ban is being reinstated is in the eye of the beholder. Basically, the court says the ban \u201cmay not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d This is who actually sued over the ban in the first place, and they remain exempt from it, for now. 4) This is the revised, scaled-back version of Trump's initial travel ban, which was also halted by the courts. And just a few weeks ago, Trump didn't seem to be a big fan of Version 2.0, tweeting, \u201cThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.\u201d We are now to believe that a ban Trump suggested was inadequate and \u201cwatered down\u201d is some big victory for his agenda? The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 5) As The Fix's Amber Phillips notes, the whole purpose of the ban is now in doubt. The White House initially pitched this as temporary travel ban needed to address an urgent national security concern while it developed more foolproof vetting procedures. It said it needed 90 days to do that (120 days for refugees); it's now been 150 days since the first attempt at a travel ban and 102 since the second (with no attacks by immigrants or refugees), but apparently the ban is still necessary? Even in their ruling, the judges seemed to allude to the idea that their input might be moot because that window had passed. Here's what the justices wrote: In addition to the issues identified in the petitions, the parties are directed to address the following question: \u201cWhether the challenges to \u00a72(c) became moot on June 14, 2017.\u201d Monday's ruling is a win for Trump only insofar as it wasn't another big setback \u2014 something he's become accustomed to both legislatively and in the courts. But this is a temporary ruling that is still blocking part of a signature executive order that Trump apparently isn't a huge fan of in the first place.

Hawaii also sued over Trump\u2019s first travel ban, and lawyers for the state told a judge in a court filing that they want to resume that litigation to ask for a temporary restraining order on the new directive. Democrats and civil liberties groups had asserted soon after Trump signed a revised executive order that more litigation was all but certain because \u2014 in their view \u2014 the measure was still a thinly veiled Muslim ban. But the new order was substantially different from the first, and there were no immediate new legal challenges.

The new order reduces the list of affected countries from seven to six \u2014 removing Iraq while keeping Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria. It explicitly exempts legal permanent residents and current visa holders, blocking only the issuance of new visas for citizens of the affected countries for 90 days. It also spells out a lengthy list of people who may be eligible for exceptions, including those previously admitted to the United States for \u201ca continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity\u201d; those with \u201csignificant business or professional obligations\u201d; and those seeking to visit or live with family. The new order keeps intact a 120-day suspension of the refu\u00adgee program, and it declares the United States will not accept more than 50,000 refugees in a year, down from the 110,000 cap set by the Obama administration. The new order is scheduled to take effect March 16, which would be March 15 in Hawaii. Justice Department lawyers have indicated that the administration intends to enforce the measure on that date, as they consider the court-ordered freeze on the previous ban no longer applicable. Hawaii, in a motion joined by Justice Department lawyers, asked to present arguments on its legal challenge to the new order on the morning of March 15 and to file briefs before that. The Justice Department has asserted that there is \u201cno imminent harm\u201d from the imposition of the new ban, as visa applicants typically have to wait months. To win a temporary restraining order, Hawaii would have to prove there was an immediate need for it.

Wall about statements during the campaign and afterward in which Trump talked about a Muslim ban. Wall said the order temporarily suspending foreign travelers from six majority Muslim countries was to protect the United States by reviewing the vetting of those who are potentially dangerous. That is not only within the president\u2019s authority, Wall said, it is his responsibility.

To restore the administration\u2019s policy in full, the Justice Department would have to win in Richmond and in its appeal of the Hawaii ruling, which is scheduled for argument on May 15 before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The losing party in either case is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court. [Federal appeals court maintains suspension of Trump's immigration order] A key issue for the court is whether judges should consider the rationale behind the policy beyond the language in the order itself. Many of the judges on Monday suggested they could not ignore the president\u2019s previous statements. Three judges, all nominated to the bench by Democrats, directly quoted Trump\u2019s remarks at the signing ceremony for the first travel ban in January. Trump said at the signing that the order was for \u201cthe protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means.\u201d [Video of signing ceremony ] Judges Robert D. King, Henry F. Floyd and James A. Wynn Jr. referred to Trump\u2019s remarks several times during the hearing. \u201cHe\u2019s never repudiated what he said about Muslims,\u201d King said. Several judges also asked whether a Trump campaign statement calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d was still on his website. The statement was brought up during a White House news briefing early Monday, and it appeared to have been removed as the courthearing in Richmond got underway. In response to the judges\u2019 questions, Wall said the meaning of Trump\u2019s statements after taking office was \u201cambiguous\u201d and that the court should defer to the president\u2019s judgment when it comes to keeping the nation safe. Keenan, however, repeatedly expressed doubts about the link between terrorism and foreign residents seeking travel visas from the six countries identified in the executive order. What is it about their nationality, she asked, that \u201crenders them suspect or renders them dangerous? I don\u2019t see anything in the text that does that.\u201d Wall said the policy was designed to give the administration time to review the vetting procedures for granting visas from countries previously identified as areas of \u201cconcern\u201d by Congress and the Obama administration. \u201cHe\u2019s not saying they are all dangerous,\u201d Wall said of the Trump\u2019s thinking. \u201cHe\u2019s saying I\u2019m not certain.\u201d [Judges take Trump at his word \u2014 and that\u2019s not been good for the president] The challenge in Maryland was brought by organizations and individuals, including a Muslim in the United States whose relative would be affected by the ban. They are being represented by the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Omar Jadwat, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing the challengers, struggled at times as he faced tough questioning, mostly by the Republican-nominated members of the court. \u201cIs the executive not entitled to some deference?\u201d asked Judge Dennis W. Shedd. Judge Paul V. Niemeyer was a particularly tough questioner, saying the president is charged with making national security decisions and that the president would be responsible if someone entering the country committed a terrorist act. The judiciary is the third branch of government, Niemeyer noted: \u201cDon\u2019t we have some respect for the first branch, and the second branch?\u201d But Jadwat said the president is \u201cnot allowed to set a policy that violates the Establishment Clause,\u201d referring to the Constitution\u2019s command that government not favor one religion over another. In a hypothetical, Jadwat speculated about how it would be perceived if a presidential candidate spoke of his dislike of Jews and, upon being elected, blocked travel from Israel because of a history of terrorist incidents there and the presence of a terrorist element in the country. The order might be neutral on its face, he said, but the intent would be clear. Shedd asked whether Jadwat\u2019s position would differ if Trump had repudiated his campaign remarks about Muslims. \u201cWhat if he says \u2018sorry\u2019 every day for a year,\u201d Shedd quipped, drawing laughter from those seated in the courtroom. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that saying sorry isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Jadwat answered. How quickly the 4th Circuit will rule is not known. But the court took the unusual step of bypassing the traditional three-judge panel and heard the case as a full group of 13.

But it asserts that citizens from those countries are \u201crarely implicated in U.S.-based terrorism,\u201d and citizenship itself is an \u201cunreliable indicator of terrorist threat to the United States.\u201d Based on an analysis of Justice Department press releases, it says of 82 people \u201cwho died in the pursuit of or were convicted of any terrorism-related federal offense,\u201d more than half were U.S.-born citizens. The report referenced eight people from Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Sudan and Yemen who it said were convicted of or died in pursuit of terrorism. It said none had done so from Syria and did not specifically mention Libya. It also excluded those merely traveling or attempting to travel to join a foreign terrorist organization. The report also concludes that while terror groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen pose a threat of attacks in the United States, the other four countries are \u201cregionally focused.\u201d That conclusion is based on another, non-classified report. Trump has said he plans to re-write his executive order \u2014 which courts have ordered frozen \u2014 and a White House official has said the new version is expected next week.

The document was released by the American Civil Liberties Union just as the organization and others settled their legal case against the government over the president\u2019s first attempt to bar citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. That directive has since been revised and replaced, and a subsequent order that tried to bar citizens of six Muslim-majority countries is still facing legal challenges. But the ACLU and others continued to pursue the lawsuit over the first travel ban in hopes they could help people enter the United States who were improperly blocked. [The government now says 746 people were held due to the travel ban. Here\u2019s why that number keeps changing.] As it stands, the Trump administration is allowed to impose a travel ban \u2014 but one that is significantly less onerous than what the president first envisioned, and it has been further watered down by court rulings. The Supreme Court in June ruled that the ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and all refugees could take effect, but the government could not bar those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as having family members here or a job or a place at a U.S. school. That state of affairs is temporary. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in October. Meanwhile, the parties are still hammering out details in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which heard arguments this week on which relatives and refugees could properly be kept out of the United States. The ACLU\u2019s lawsuit stemmed from Trump\u2019s first travel ban, which caused chaos at airports nationwide as people were detained and sometimes deported after they landed in the country. Although Trump would later revoke and revise that order, the ACLU pressed to get a complete accounting of those affected. Government officials have provided an evolving account of the impact of the first travel ban before it was halted by the court system. The Monday after the ban was implemented, Trump declared on Twitter, \u201cOnly 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning.\u201d Later, the Justice Department turned over to the ACLU a list of 746 names of people held, in any capacity, because of the executive order during a 26\u00bd hour stretch from Jan. 28 to Jan. 29. A Department of Homeland Security official said at the time that the difference in counts was likely attributable to officials taking different snapshots in time. The latest list, which says it is for the period from Jan. 27 to Feb. 4, denotes more than 1,900 people who faced secondary screening. Dozens of those, according to the list, seem to have left the United States, either voluntarily or because the government forced them to. The Justice Department referred questions on the figure to the Department of Homeland Security. A spokesman there said he was researching the matter. To settle the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit, the government agreed to email those who had been turned away, providing them with an explanation of their rights and a list of free legal services. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said the agreement was an important end to the litigation that first halted Trump\u2019s travel ban \u2014 although it was an unnecessarily hard fought battle. \u201cThis is one of those situations where the government should have just done it,\u201d Gelernt said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t need months and months of wrangling in court.\u201d Gelernt said the number of people held \u2014 even if briefly \u2014 was notable, calling into question the figures the government had previously offered. And Gelernt said the ACLU would press for more documents because it was not convinced that what they had was complete. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said in a statement that although the case had been \u201cmoot since March, when the President rescinded the original executive order,\u201d the government believed it had settled the matter \u201con favorable terms.\u201d", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-08-31", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "What\u2019s next for Trump travel ban 2.0", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/16/whats-next-for-trump-travel-ban-2-0/", "text": " President Trump said during a campaign rally in Nashville on March 15 that he \u201cought to\u201d restore his first travel ban, after a federal judge blocked a revised version. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland handed President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban two significant defeats Wednesday and Thursday, blocking critical sections of the executive order just hours before officials were set to enforce them. Soon after the first ruling, Trump vowed at a campaign rally to take the case to the Supreme Court, if need be, while also declaring that he \u201cought to\u201d restore his original travel ban and fight for it in court. Trump has been in a similar predicament before, after a federal judge in Washington state suspended his first travel ban. His options now, though, seem even more limited. He already has revoked and rewritten the order \u2014 and even the significant changes he made weren\u2019t enough to convince the judiciary that his directive should be allowed to take effect, at least for now. He has two rulings against him in two federal circuits, meaning he\u2019ll now have to persuade two appeals courts to overturn lower judges\u2019 rulings to immediately lift the freeze on his ban, said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School. A federal judge in Washington also is expected to weigh in soon. [Federal judge in Hawaii freezes President Trump\u2019s new entry ban] All roads, legal analysts say, are now likely lead to the Supreme Court, although the Justice Department has said only that it will \u201ccontinue to defend this Executive Order in the courts.\u201d Here are the government\u2019s options, and the path that analysts say administration officials are most likely to take as they seek to restore Trump\u2019s new travel ban. (1) Ask for appellate court intervention, and do it quickly The last time around, Justice Department lawyers filed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit an emergency motion to stop a lower judge\u2019s freeze on his ban. That bid was rejected, and ultimately, a three-judge panel ruled unanimously that the ban should remain on hold. Hawaii, where U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson issued the most sweeping suspension of Trump\u2019s new ban Wednesday, is in the 9th Circuit, so Trump\u2019s appeal would again have to go through that court. The court has a reputation for being liberal, and Trump has referred to it as a circuit \u201cin chaos.\u201d The 4th Circuit \u2014 of which Maryland is a part \u2014 had a reputation for being more conservative, although in recent years, it has seemed to become more liberal, said Leon Fresco, the deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Immigration Litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department. [Second federal judge blocks revised Trump travel ban] Yale-Loehr said the government\u2019s first step probably would be to appeal both places, as a favorable ruling in one case would not undo the restraining order in the other. U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang, the federal judge in Maryland, issued a somewhat narrower restraining order than the one in Hawaii, but it was still significant. He blocked the key section of the executive order that stopped the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries, while Watson, the judge in Hawaii, blocked that and the section that suspended the U.S. refugee program. If the Justice Department were to again file an emergency motion to stop Watson\u2019s ruling, it would get three judges to consider it. The motions panel for March is composed of Milan D. Smith Jr., an appointee of President George W. Bush; Morgan Christen, an Obama appointee; and John B. Owens, also an Obama appointee. The judges who rejected the last appeal were Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by Obama; Richard R. Clifton, who was appointed by Bush; and William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter. The considerations this time are somewhat different. Trump\u2019s first executive order barred entry to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, and it resulted in the provisional revocation of tens of thousands of visas. The new ban does not affect current visa holders. It affects only six countries and it spells out a robust list of people who might be able to apply for exceptions. Both bans suspended the refugee program. The previous 9th Circuit ruling, though, is instructive in many ways. The three-judge panel wrote, for example, that even a ban that exempted green-card holders and others would not address their concerns about U.S. citizens with an interest in noncitizens\u2019 right to travel. And the district court rulings on the new ban pointed extensively to comments by Trump and his top advisers indicating that they wanted to prevent Muslims from entering the United States. The Justice Department would have to convince the appeals courts that that evidence \u2014 which judges in Hawaii and Maryland wrote is a strong indication that the ban might disfavor one religion and violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \u2014 should not be considered, is not relevant or does not show what those suing claim it does. Notably, the 9th Circuit revealed Wednesday that a majority of its judges had not voted to reconsider en banc the opinion by its three-judge panel on the first travel ban. Five judges, though, signed on to a dissent, declaring that Trump was well within his authority even the first time, and that the controversy over the measure\u2019s implementation might have led to an erroneous decision. \u201cWe are all acutely aware of the enormous controversy and chaos that attended the issuance of the Executive Order. People contested the extent of the national security interests at stake, and they debated the value that the Executive Order added to our security against the real suffering of potential emigres,\u201d Judge Jay S. Bybee wrote for the dissenters. \u201cAs tempting as it is to use the judicial power to balance those competing interests as we see fit, we cannot let our personal inclinations get ahead of important, overarching principles about who gets to make decisions in our democracy.\u201d Fresco, who now works at the Holland & Knight law firm, said that although he was \u201cnot personally in favor of the travel ban,\u201d the dissenters raised some important points, and that the Hawaii decision was far from a \u201cslam dunk.\u201d In particular, he said, it did not address the question of whether the president\u2019s comments can \u201cirrevocably stain the ability to ever issue an order like this.\u201d \u201cI actually think the Supreme Court will be the first legitimate grappling with these issues,\u201d Fresco said. (2) Review the vetting procedures, with an eye on issuing something short of a ban The next executive order, like the last one, is supposed to be a temporary measure \u2014 implemented so that the Homeland Security secretary and other agency heads could review U.S. vetting procedures and the information provided by other countries about their citizens wanting to come to the United States. The order commanded the Homeland Security secretary to provide, within 20 days of when the order was to take effect, a determination of what information the United States would need to vet travelers and a list of countries not providing adequate data. Those countries would then be given 50 days to start providing the information, according to the order. The administration was supposed to have been working on that review the first time around, but with a new order came new deadlines. Although it probably wants to win in court to avoid an authority-curtailing precedent, Fresco said the administration could simply finish its review and implement new vetting procedures that did not impose an outright ban. That might make the litigation moot, he said. (3) Restore the old order? Not if Trump wants to win, analysts say. At a rally on Wednesday not long after the judge in Hawaii had ruled, Trump floated a wholly different solution. \u201cI think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place,\u201d he told a cheering crowd. It is technically possible that he could do that. Yale-Loehr said Trump \u201ccould reinstate his earlier executive order, but he would be foolish to do so,\u201d particularly given the 9th Circuit\u2019s rulings. Fresco said the president\u2019s only option left would be the Supreme Court, where he would have to deal with all the legal problems that his revised order sought to eliminate. \u201cI think that is going to be received with a very ugly reception in the Supreme Court, where I don\u2019t think that would necessarily be the case with this new travel ban,\u201d Fresco said.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Second federal judge blocks revised Trump travel ban", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/second-federal-judge-blocks-revised-trump-travel-ban/2017/03/16/dc47cd1e-0a2a-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html", "text": "President Trump said at a rally in Nasvhille he \u201cought to\u201d restore his first travel ban, after a federal judge blocked a revised version of the measure. (Mark Humphrey/AP) A second federal judge issued an injunction Thursday blocking enforcement of one of the critical sections of President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, using Trump\u2019s own comments against him in deciding that the ban was likely to run afoul of the Constitution. The decision from U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang in federal court in Maryland marks another win for challengers of the president\u2019s executive order, which had been slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. Earlier, a different federal judge in Hawaii stopped it. Chuang\u2019s order did not sweep as broadly as the one in Hawaii, but he similarly declared that even the revised travel ban was intended to discriminate against Muslims. He said those wanting evidence of anti-Muslim intent need look no further than what the president himself has said about it. Chuang\u2019s ruling won\u2019t upend or call into question the decision in Hawaii, instead offering some measure of reinforcement, and a different appeals court through which the government would likely have to pass. \u201cThe history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the Second Executive Order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban,\u201d Chuang wrote. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) [Read the federal judge\u2019s ruling in Md. on Trump\u2019s revised travel ban] Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer representing those challenging the ban in Maryland, said the ruling in his case was significant in that \u201ctwo judges have looked at the revised order, and both have come to the same conclusion that it continues to be a Muslim ban.\u201d He said he was also encouraged that yet another judge was willing to look beyond the order itself to the president\u2019s comments and other potential evidence of discriminatory intent. The Justice Department said that it strongly disagreed with the ruling in the Hawaii case, and that the executive order Trump issued \u201cfalls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation\u2019s security.\u201d The government\u2019s next legal step is unclear. The Justice Department has said only that it will \u201ccontinue to defend this Executive Order in the courts.\u201d [What\u2019s next for Trump travel ban 2.0] At a rally in Nashville on Wednesday, Trump said he was prepared to take the case to the Supreme Court. He also mused about a return to his original executive order, which imposed a more sweeping ban than the second. \u201cLet me tell you something. I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.\u201d The first order temporarily barred entry for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and suspended the U.S. refu\u00adgee program. When it was implemented, the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas, and some travelers affected while in transit were detained and deported from U.S. airports. Officials had hoped the revised version would be more defensible in court. It reduced the list of countries affected to six \u2014 removing Iraq, while keeping Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria. It also applied only to those seeking new visas, and spelled out a robust list of those who might be exempted. The new order maintained the suspension of the refu\u00adgee program. [Federal judge in Hawaii freezes President Trump\u2019s new entry ban] On Wednesday, with the order set to go into effect in just hours, federal judges in three states heard urgent challenges to the measure. The case in Maryland was brought by three organizations and six people, claiming the order affected their work or prevented their family members from the affected countries from getting visas to enter the United States. Chuang blocked only the provision of the new order affecting the issuance of visas to those from the six affected countries. He said those suing had \u201cnot provided a sufficient basis\u201d for him to declare the other sections invalid. In Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson went further, also suspending the portion of the order that affected refugees. His ruling will be undisturbed by Chuang\u2019s, and appeals courts would ultimately have to decide to what extent each of them was right. Justice Department lawyers had argued that the ban was necessary for national security. As evidence to support their claim, they pointed to a request from the U.S. attorney general and homeland security secretary \u2014 penned March 6, after the first ban had been frozen \u2014 asking for the measure. They also pointed to more than 300 people who they said entered the United States as refugees and were the subjects of counterterrorism investigations Chuang wrote that he \u201cshould not, and will not, second-guess the conclusion that national security interests would be served by the travel ban,\u201d but if the national security rationale was secondary to an attempt to disfavor a particular religion, he had no choice but to block the executive order. \u201cIn this highly unique case,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban.\u201d The same federal district court judge in Washington who blocked Trump\u2019s first travel ban is also considering challenges to the new one.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Former top diplomats, tech giants blast immigration order as court showdown looms", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-appeals-to-restore-travel-ban-says-earlier-ruling-was-second-guessing-the-president/2017/02/05/6fcdbb5a-eb4c-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html", "text": "Fresh challenges to President Trump\u2019s court-frozen immigration order took shape Monday with two former secretaries of state claiming the White House was undermining national security and nearly 100 Silicon Valley tech companies arguing it will keep the best minds from coming to America.

People pouring in. Bad!\u201d Trump further came to the defense of his stalled order Monday. In a tweet, Trump dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d various polls showing opposition to the executive order. \u201cSorry,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cpeople want border security and extreme vetting.\u201d [The order denying the Trump administration\u2019s request to restore the travel ban] The next few days will be telling for the future of the president\u2019s executive order. The states of Washington and Minnesota, which are challenging the ban, asked the appeals court in the wee hours of Monday to keep the ban suspended, and Justice Department lawyers have until 6 p.m. to respond. The court will then schedule a hearing or rule whether the ban should remain on hold. Early Monday, two former secretaries of state \u2014 John F.

The brief claimed the order was a \u201csignificant departure\u201d from U.S. immigration policies and \u201cmakes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world\u2019s best employees.\u201d [Court document: Amicus brief by tech companies] In the meantime, people who had been stranded in legal limbo rushed to fly back to the United States. Some successfully reunited with family members, while others \u2014 particularly those whose visas were physically taken or marked as invalid \u2014 ran into roadblocks trying to board planes overseas. At Dulles on Sunday, immigration lawyers could be heard on phones, arguing with airline representatives to let their passengers board as some seemed confused over the various court rulings and what they meant. On Monday, the Somali traveler Aidid was elated once he heard the entry stamp hitting his passport.

From Dulles, Aidid headed to his aunt\u2019s home in Asburn to get some rest. What lies ahead is likely to be a weeks-long battle that will be waged in courtrooms across the country over whether Trump\u2019s ban can pass legal muster. Federal courts in New York, California and elsewhere have blocked aspects of the ban from being implemented, although one federal judge in Massachusetts said he did not think that challengers had demonstrated that they had a high likelihood of success. The lawsuits now stretch from D.C. to Hawaii, and the number seems to grow regularly. The Trump administration has been steadfast in its support of the executive order, which it says is necessary for national security, and the president himself tweeted repeatedly his disdain for the judge in Washington state who put a stop to it. \u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump wrote Saturday. [Trump lashes out at \u2018so-called judge\u2019 who temporarily blocked entry ban] Vice President Pence said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d that White House officials felt that Trump was \u201coperating within his authority as president, both under the Constitution and under clear statutory law.\u201d Legal analysts have said the president has broad authority to set immigration policy, although civil liberties advocates have countered that the order essentially amounts to a discriminatory ban on Muslims that has no real national security purpose. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to prevail,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe\u2019ll accomplish the stay and will win the case on the merits. But again, the focus here is on the safety and security of the American people.\u201d On Sunday morning television talk shows, some Republicans in Congress took issue with comments by the president, particularly his description of U.S. District Judge James L. Robart as a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t understand language like that,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have so-called judges, we don\u2019t have so-called senators, we don\u2019t have so-called presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. . . . So, we don\u2019t have any so-called judges, we have real judges.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said: \u201cWe all get disappointed from time to time at the outcome in courts on things that we care about. But I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually.\u201d McConnell went on to offer a broader critique of Trump\u2019s executive order than he had previously: \u201cWe all want to try to keep terrorists out of the United States. But we can\u2019t shut down travel. We certainly don\u2019t want Muslim allies who have fought with us in countries overseas to not be able to travel to the United States. We need to be careful about this.\u201d Several federal judges have ruled against the administration on its implementation of the ban, though the case now before the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit is perhaps the most significant one. It stems from a lawsuit brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota, which alleged that the immigration order was \u201cseparating families, harming thousands of the States\u2019 residents, damaging the States\u2019 economies, hurting State-based companies, and undermining both States\u2019 sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees.\u201d Responding to those arguments, Robart temporarily halted the ban on Friday. Then, 9th Circuit Judges William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and Michelle Taryn Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, denied the Justice Department\u2019s request on Sunday to immediately restore it. [Travelers from Iran board flights to the United States following stay, attorney says] The Justice Department could have gone straight to the Supreme Court, but a Justice Department spokesman said it would not do so. \u201cWith the fast briefing schedule the appeals court laid out, we do not plan to ask the Supreme Court for an immediate stay but instead let the appeals process play out,\u201d spokesman Peter Carr said. Although the side that loses can request intervention from the nation\u2019s highest judicial body, it would take the votes of five justices to overturn the panel\u2019s decision. The court has been shorthanded since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago, and it is ideologically divided between four more liberal justices and four conservative-leaning ones. Leon Fresco, deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in Obama\u2019s Justice Department, said he was \u201csurprised that there is this exuberance to immediately rescind the executive order,\u201d particularly given the timing issues. Trump\u2019s order, which barred all refugees as well as citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States, was temporary. Refugees were banned for 120 days. The others were barred for 90 days, except those from Syria, whose travel to the United States was blocked indefinitely. The order was purportedly designed to give the administration time to formulate a plan on how to vet people coming from countries that have terrorist activity. \u201cIt is perplexing why the government wouldn\u2019t want to simply, at this point, maintain an orderly process in one court as opposed to fighting it out all across the country in different courts, and working its way to the Supreme Court,\u201d Fresco said. \u201cUnless the goal is to have an outright travel ban forever, and we should take the president at his word that that\u2019s not the goal, then let\u2019s just have calmer heads prevail and conduct the security analysis that was going to be conducted during these 90 days.\u201d Indeed, if Trump\u2019s ban were to be immediately reinstated, that might spark chaos similar to what occurred when it was first rolled out on Jan. 27. To implement the order then, the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas. When people began landing at U.S. airports, Customs and Border Protection officers detained more than 100 people and deported some, sparking protests and lawsuits across the country. It was unclear Sunday whether U.S. officials had a plan in place to avoid a repeat of that scenario, though much would depend on what specifically was ordered by a court, and when. Spokesmen for the State Department and Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on the question. In an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News that aired Sunday afternoon, Trump insisted that the initial implementation of his order was \u201cvery smooth\u201d and said \u2014 misleadingly \u2014 that \u201cyou had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers, and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully.\u201d That does not take into account the tens of thousands of people who could not travel because their visa was revoked; nor does it acknowledge those who were taken out of the country after their plane landed. The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that because of Robart\u2019s ruling, it was suspending enforcement of the executive order entirely, and the State Department restored the visas that had been provisionally revoked. Advocates encouraged travelers from the affected countries who qualified for entry to get on planes as soon as possible because of the unpredictable legal terrain. Early Sunday, the Justice Department asked the appeals court to intervene, asserting that it was improper for a lower court to engage in \u201csecond-guessing\u201d of the president\u2019s judgment on a national security matter. [The Justice Department\u2019s argument to restore the travel ban] \u201cThe injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the nation\u2019s elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and \u00adsecond-guesses the President\u2019s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk,\u201d acting solicitor general Noel Francisco wrote in a brief. It is somewhat unusual for a district judge to issue an order that affects the entire country, but Robart, who was nominated by President George W. Bush and has been on the bench since 2004, said it was necessary to follow Congress\u2019s intention that \u201cthe immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly.\u201d He was quoting from a 2015 appeals court ruling that had blocked Obama\u2019s executive action that would have made it easier for undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States. It was never implemented because of legal challenges. Antonio Olivo, Fred Barbash, Darryl Fears, Mike DeBonis, Spencer S.

Warren/AP) The Trump administration got some of what it wanted when the Supreme Court decided to allow a scaled-back version of the president\u2019s travel ban to take effect. But the court\u2019s ruling also put pressure on officials to press ahead with their review of the information other countries are able to gather on potential U.S.-bound travelers \u2014 which might ultimately produce more rigorous vetting procedures or a completely new ban. The U.S. already has stepped up vetting of foreigners, having consular officers around the world ask visa applicants for their social media handles and requiring applicants to list 15 years of travel history, including the source of funding for their trips. Trump\u2019s travel ban, though, contemplates even more-restrictive measures, and the president himself has, counter to the representation of Justice Department lawyers, suggested that the measure is not a mere \u201cpause\u201d for assessment. \u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter this month. [What the Supreme Court\u2019s travel-ban ruling means] (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) The Supreme Court\u2019s decision Monday means that \u2014 at least for now \u2014 the administration can decline to issue visas to residents of six majority-Muslim countries, provided that those seeking the visas \u201clack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d That means those from the six countries who have family members in the United States, job offers or school acceptance letters should be able to get in, although others without such ties should not. The court said the same standard should be applied to refugees who also would have been blocked under Trump\u2019s ban. Trump indicated in a recent memo that he would begin enforcing his ban 72 hours after \u201call applicable injunctions are lifted or stayed.\u201d In a statement, Trump called the ruling \u201ca clear victory for our national security\u201d and said it \u201callows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation\u2019s homeland.\u201d State, Justice Department and Homeland Security officials have said they are still reviewing and discussing the decision to see how it should be implemented, and a Justice Department official said lawyers were readying for more possible legal challenges on the question of who had a \u201cbona fide\u201d U.S. tie. [Trump said dangerous people might be pouring in without his travel ban. But he\u2019s not rushing to restore it.] The court\u2019s decision did not offer finality. Although the justices partially lifted lower courts\u2019 injunctions on Trump\u2019s ban, they said they would take up the case fully in their October term. The ban on entry to the United States was supposed to have been temporary: 90 days for citizens of Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and Syria, and 120 days for refugees. By the time the court hears the case, the landscape almost certainly will have shifted. Within 20 days of the ban\u2019s taking effect, the secretary of homeland security is supposed to submit to Trump a report on the information needed from countries to adjudicate applications for entry to the United States, and a list of which countries do not provide such information. The countries on the list are then supposed to be given 50 days to begin providing the required information. If they do not, they could be included in a proclamation that would block \u201cappropriate categories\u201d of their citizens from coming to the United States, according to the executive order. Jonathan Meyer, who was a deputy general counsel in the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama and now works in private practice at the Sheppard Mullin law firm, said the Trump administration could make the argument that \u201cthey still can\u2019t do [the review] because all of the injunctions haven\u2019t been lifted,\u201d but he expected that the administration would press ahead. The Supreme Court wrote: \u201cWe fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments\u201d within 90 days. The conclusion of that review could mean increased vetting: for example, not just asking travelers for their social media profiles, but also their passwords or other data, Meyer said. And the executive order, he said, contemplated \u201csome sort of longer-lasting ban or partial ban\u201d on nationals from countries that could not provide the requested information. Some of the countries on the list are experiencing military conflicts \u2014 which would probably make providing the requested data difficult. A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman did not provide comment.

(Andrew Harnik/AP) Not long after a federal judge froze his entry ban the first time around, President Trump took to Twitter to issue an ominous warning. With the ban no longer in place, Trump wrote, \u201cmany very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country.\u201d Before the sun rose the next day, lawyers at the Justice Department asked a higher court to \u2014 on an emergency basis \u2014 halt the ruling of the lower judge and let the ban take effect. The speed with which the administration moved was befitting of the national security crisis the ban purported to address. The administration ultimately lost in court, and since then, it has slowed the pace considerably, putting off a rewrite of the executive order several times and now proceeding more gradually as it fights court-imposed suspensions of the new ban. Legal analysts and opponents say the Justice Department is likely pursuing a more methodical, strategic approach in hopes of a long-term victory \u2014 although in the process, the administration is hurting its case that the order is needed for urgent national security. \u201cIf they don\u2019t try to move the case as quickly as possible,\u201d said Leon Fresco, deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department, \u201cit does undermine the security rationale.\u201d [Revised Trump immigration order, delayed after speech, will not ban citizens from Iraq] Trump\u2019s new travel order \u2014 which suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and blocked the issuance of new visas to citizens of Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Somalia and Syria for 90 days \u2014 was supposed to take effect March 16, but U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii blocked the administration from enforcing the critical sections of it. Early the next day, a federal judge in Maryland issued a similar ruling \u2014 leaving the administration with two different cases, in two different appellate circuits, that they would need to get overturned before they could begin carrying out the president\u2019s directive. All roads seemed to lead to the Supreme Court. But now it seems all but certain that the president\u2019s revised entry ban will stay suspended at least into April, and possibly longer. Lawyers for the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal in the Maryland case a day after the judge there ruled, but \u2014 unlike last time \u2014 they did not ask the higher court to immediately set aside the freeze on the new ban. They said they will do so Friday, but those challenging the ban will have a week to respond, and the Justice Department will then be allowed to file more written arguments by April 5. The Trump administration has been content to let the court battle play out even more slowly in Hawaii, not elevating the dispute beyond a lower-court judge. The Justice Department has not filed a notice of its intent to appeal the ruling, and the next hearing in that case is set for March 29. Justice Department lawyers wrote Thursday that they would appeal to a higher court if that hearing doesn\u2019t resolve in their favor. The courts will ultimately have to decide important questions, including how much authority they have to weigh in on the president\u2019s national security determinations, whether Trump\u2019s order was meant to discriminate against Muslims, and whether and how the president\u2019s and his advisers\u2019 own comments can be used against them. There could be strategic reasons for pumping the brakes. Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School, said the Justice Department might be hoping for a favorable ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, of which Maryland is a part, before they bring a case before the 9th Circuit, of which Hawaii is a part. A three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit unanimously rejected the administration\u2019s bid to restore Trump\u2019s first entry ban after it was frozen. The 4th Circuit on Thursday scheduled oral argument in its case for May 8. And the Justice Department could be playing an even longer game, hoping that by the time the case makes its way to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch will have joined the justices and brought to an end what many see as a 4-to-4 split along ideological lines, said Jonathan E. Meyer, a former deputy general counsel in the Department of Homeland Security under Obama who now works in private practice at Sheppard Mullin. \u201cI think this ultimately goes to the Supreme Court, and I think it is likely to find a Supreme Court that is much more open to the government\u2019s arguments once Judge Gorsuch is confirmed and sworn in,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cSo it\u2019s quite possible that part of what is going on right now is slowing things down to allow that to happen.\u201d The delay, though, undercuts one of the president\u2019s primary arguments for the ban: that it is temporary and needed for national security while the administration reevaluates its vetting procedures for foreign travelers. Officials have had since Jan. 27 to conduct such a review, though Watson\u2019s ruling in Hawaii seems to now stop them from doing so now. Fresco, the former Obama administration official who works in private practice at Holland & Knight, said he wonders why the administration has not simply unveiled new vetting procedures and done away entirely with a temporary ban \u2014 unless its ultimate goal is a long-term ban. \u201cIf they wanted to do a ban, and the ban was supposed to be permanent, then all of this would make sense,\u201d Fresco said. [7 things Trump and his advisers have said about the travel ban that wound up hurting them in court] Asked for comment for this report, a Justice Department spokeswoman referred a reporter to the department\u2019s request for an expedited briefing schedule in the appeal of the Maryland case. After Trump signed his first entry ban on Jan. 27, the measure took effect so suddenly that people aboard flights were detained and, in some cases, deported, when they arrived at U.S. airports, sparking confusion, protests and legal challenges. To implement the directive \u2014 which banned entry to all refugees and citizens of Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Somalia and Syria \u2014 the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas. Trump wrote on Twitter that such dramatic and sudden steps were necessary because of what might happen if people were given advance warning. \u201cf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u2018bad\u2019 would rush into our country during that week,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cA lot of bad \u2018dudes\u2019 out there!\u201d If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 Judges quickly ruled against the measure, stopping U.S. officials from detaining and deporting those who made it to the United States. Then, on Feb. 3, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Washington state froze the order almost entirely. As Justice Department lawyers prepared an appeal, Trump tweeted several times the following day about the consequences of the judge\u2019s decision, even suggesting the judiciary might be responsible if someone were to launch an attack. \u201cBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision,\u201d he wrote. He added later: \u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\u201d Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 The Justice Department made a bid to get Robart\u2019s order put on hold, but lost. Several days later, on Feb. 9, they were handed a more significant defeat when a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declared unanimously that Robart was right. Instead of taking the case even higher, the administration essentially backed down, declaring a new order would be written and then repeatedly putting it off. Trump or White House officials thrice promised a new order was coming, only to delay signing it until the week that followed. The new order was substantially different from the first, blocking only the issuance of new visas and spelling out a robust list of people who could be exempted. It also removed Iraq from the list of affected countries. But Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer who is involved in the Maryland case, said the government\u2019s delays \u201cat every stage of the Muslim ban process, including issuing the revised order, has suggested that they don\u2019t actually believe that there\u2019s an urgent need for the bans to go into effect.\u201d Fresco said the administration seemed to be prioritizing a long-term win in court, and Trump probably felt \u201che\u2019s already made his explanation to the American people that he\u2019s tried, that he\u2019s doing as much as he can.\u201d \u201cThe last thing they want to do is have this travel ban issue, especially on an expedited basis, and lose again,\u201d Fresco said. [Trump\u2019s new travel ban still wouldn\u2019t have kept out anyone behind deadly U.S. terror attacks] Former diplomats and national security professionals have long called into question the necessity of Trump\u2019s entry ban as a public safety measure \u2014 even in its revised form. More than 130 former U.S. officials, among them Cabinet secretaries, ambassadors and generals, recently sent a letter to the administration warning that the directive would actually damage national security. Internal data available to the administration also appears to be in conflict with the reasons officials have given publicly for it. One report, which analyzed 90 cases of suspected or confirmed foreign-born terrorists, found most became extremists after they got to the United States, as opposed to arriving with nefarious intentions. The executive order itself says that more than 300 people who came to the United States as refugees are now the subjects of FBI counterterrorism investigations. Separately, it highlights hundreds of people \u201cborn abroad\u201d who were convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States and points to two separate cases involving refugees from Iraq and Somalia. It also describes the conditions in each of the Muslim-majority countries whose citizens, if the ban were to take effect, would no longer be able to get new visas. The president has broad authority to set immigration policy, and analysts said it is possible that Trump will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court. How soon that will be, though, remains decidedly unclear.

(Mike Theiler/Reuters) The president\u2019s tweets could significantly damage his administration\u2019s effort to restore the ban, which has been put on hold by two federal courts. Next week, those suing are expected to file arguments on the matter with the Supreme Court, and Trump\u2019s latest remarks will surely be part of their briefs. The administration appealed to the nation\u2019s highest court after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the freeze on the ban last month. Neal Katyal, the lawyer who argued for the challengers in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, wrote on Twitter, \u201cIts kinda odd to have the defendant in HawaiivTrump acting as our co-counsel. We don\u2019t need the help but will take it!\u201d He also wrote that he was \u201cwaiting now for the inevitable cover-my-tweet posts from him that the Solicitor General will no doubt insist upon.\u201d Even George Conway, a prominent lawyer who recently took himself out of the running to lead the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division and who is the husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, posted on Twitter that the remarks might hurt the legal case. \u201cThese tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won\u2019t help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad,\u201d he wrote, using abbreviations for Office of Solicitor General and the Supreme Court. [Conway: President\u2019s tweets \u2018certainly won\u2019t help\u2019] A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned that his tweets might muddy the legal case, and his attention was instead on the substance of his executive order. She said she was not aware of any vetting of his tweets by lawyers or aides. View Graphic How Trump\u2019s travel ban broke from the normal executive order process \u201cThe president is very focused on exactly what that order spells out, and that\u2019s protecting Americans, protecting national security, and he has every constitutional authority to do that through that executive order and he maintains that, and that position hasn\u2019t changed in the slightest,\u201d Sanders said. Trump himself indicated late in the day that he had no intention of backing down from his early morning sentiments, tweeting, \u201cThat\u2019s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won\u2019t help us protect our people!\u201d Federal judges across the country have focused acutely on Trump\u2019s own comments in ordering that the ban be frozen, determining that the president\u2019s words expose the measure as being a tool for discrimination disguised as a national security directive. [President Trump\u2019s lawyers on revised travel ban repeatedly asked about campaign promises] The majority opinion in the 4th Circuit maintaining the freeze on the ban quoted extensively from Trump\u2019s tweets and media interviews, and from those of his advisers. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Omar C. Jadwat, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case in the 4th Circuit, wrote that Trump\u2019s tweets amounted to \u201ca promise: let me do this and I\u2019ll take it as license to do even worse.\u201d In an interview, Jadwat said the president\u2019s tweets \u201cseem to undermine the picture the government\u2019s been trying to paint.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure what our brief is going to look like, but this stuff seems relevant,\u201d Jadwat said. Government lawyers have sought to convince judges that they should not consider the president\u2019s statements but instead limit their analysis to the text of the ban. They have also sought to portray the president\u2019s words as campaign trail rhetoric, and noted that many of the remarks in question \u2014 though not all \u2014 came before Trump was elected. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t start down the road of psychoanalyzing what people meant on the campaign trail,\u201d acting solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall told judges at a recent court hearing in the 9th Circuit. Trump\u2019s latest tweets \u2014 which were later set to dramatic music and posted in a video on his Facebook page \u2014 will provide those challenging the ban more examples of post-election remarks and a stronger case that Trump\u2019s revised travel ban had the same purpose as the original version. That version, which unilaterally revoked the visas of tens of thousands of people from seven Muslim-majority countries, was seen as much harder to defend because it was more onerous and had a provision in the text that seemed designed to exempt Christian travelers. Trump tweeted Monday that the Justice Department \u201cshould have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted\u201d to the Supreme Court. In addition to creating possible headaches in court, that misstates the process. Trump signed the executive order imposing the ban. The Justice Department defends his policies in court. Trump also wrote that the Justice Department \u201cshould ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court \u2014 & seek much tougher version!\u201d The Supreme Court would not be the body to enact a ban; the justices will be weighing whether Trump\u2019s order is constitutional. The travel ban seems to have been on Trump\u2019s mind since the terrorist attack in London on Saturday, when Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d [Trump ramps up push for travel ban even as opposition hardens] Legal analysts were quick to point out that the president was hurting his own case. \u201cIn case it\u2019s not obvious, these will only undermine the government\u2019s case before #SCOTUS for both a stay & on the merits of the #TravelBan,\u201d University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck posted on Twitter. \u201cThese will also go a long way toward mooting debate over use of campaign statements; no need when, as President, he still says these things.\u201d Trump also wrote on Twitter that the administration was already \u201cEXTREME VETTING\u201d travelers coming into the United States \u2014 which he said was necessary to keep the country safe because courts are \u201cslow and political!\u201d The Department of Homeland Security has previously suggested such vetting was taking place, but that, too, seems to undercut the Justice Department\u2019s legal position. The travel ban was supposed to be a temporary measure, designed to afford the administration time to conduct a review and decide what new vetting procedures were necessary. When a federal judge in Hawaii ordered the ban frozen, though, the government interpreted his order as stopping even that review \u2014 and the judge declined to clarify that it did not. Wall told the 4th Circuit last month that the administration had \u201cput our pens down\u201d and had \u201cdone nothing to review the vetting procedures for these countries.\u201d If the administration already has implemented new vetting procedures, that would seem to call into question the necessity of a temporary ban. Legal analysts, though, have previously said that president\u2019s remarks indicate he might not view the measure as temporary \u2014 despite what the text of the executive order says.

(Jon Elswick/AP) President Trump\u2019s latest travel ban could block the issuance of tens of thousands of visas each year to people who want to immigrate to the United States or come on business or as tourists, according to a Washington Post review of State Department data, and it is threatening to short-circuit the impending Supreme Court showdown over whether Trump can lawfully impose such wide-ranging travel restrictions. On Monday, the Supreme Court put off \u2014 at least for now \u2014 a hearing on Trump\u2019s previous travel ban, asking instead for briefs on whether the latest restrictions mean there is nothing left for the justices to decide. [Supreme Court postpones hearing on Trump\u2019s travel ban] Opponents of the ban, meanwhile, vowed to fight on \u2014 asserting that the new measure inflicted some of the same harms of the first and that it was driven by the same discriminatory intent. \u201cFor us, this was a Muslim ban, and it remains a Muslim ban,\u201d said Zahra Billoo, the executive director of the San Francisco chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The newest ban is in some ways even more expansive than the last \u2014 remaining in effect indefinitely and imposing restrictions on eight, rather than six, countries. But unlike the last ban, the restrictions vary from place to place, and countries that increase their cooperation and information-sharing with the United States might be able to find their way off the list. For Syria and North Korea, the president\u2019s proclamation blocks immigrants wanting to relocate to the United States and non-immigrants wishing to visit in some capacity. For Iran, the proclamation blocks both immigrants and non-immigrants, though it exempts students and those participating in a cultural exchange. The proclamation blocks people from Chad, Libya and Yemen from coming to the United States as immigrants or on business or tourist visas, and it blocks people from Somalia from coming as immigrants. The proclamation names Venezuela, but it only blocks certain government officials. A Washington Post review of State Department data found that more than 65,000 visas were issued in fiscal 2016 that would now likely fall under the ban. The ban, though, contains a robust list of people who might qualify for a case-by-case exception, including those with significant U.S. contacts or those wanting to visit close family members. The ban also exempts those already admitted to the United States on the effective date of the proclamation \u2014 which, for those not affected by the previous travel ban, is Oct. 18. The Supreme Court had been set to hear arguments on Trump\u2019s previous travel ban, inked in March, but on Monday, it removed that hearing from the calendar and asked for briefs on whether the case was now moot. One significant piece of the previous executive order \u2014 the 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States \u2014 remains in effect until Oct. 24. The latest ban leaves unclear what will happen after that. U.S. officials have been discussing possibly lowering the refu\u00adgee cap for fiscal 2018 to below 50,000. The fiscal year begins Sunday. President Trump added North Korea, Chad and Venezuela to his administration's existing travel ban. (The Washington Post) Many legal observers think the new directive will make moot the court\u2019s examination of the second executive order. While the court\u2019s three most conservative justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 would have allowed Trump\u2019s order to go into effect as written, the rest of the court has looked for a middle ground. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the court will have much appetite to decide\u201d the merits of the dispute with a new order in place, Kannon Shanmugam, a Washington lawyer who argues frequently before the court, said last week. In their initial briefs, lawyers for challengers of the executive order \u2014 immigrant groups and the state of Hawaii \u2014 as well as the Justice Department argued that the case was not moot. Those arguments came before the latest order was issued but with an awareness that the ban could expire before the court heard the case. After the new proclamation was released, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco suggested to the justices that they order new briefings from the parties about how it affected the case. Opponents of the ban were largely mum on what the legal path forward would be. \u201cIt does continue to injure our current plaintiffs,\u201d said Justin Cox, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center. To establish the new ban, U.S. officials conducted a worldwide review of the information countries were able to provide on their travelers wanting to come to the United States. Initially, 16 countries were deemed inadequate, and 31 were at risk of becoming inadequate, authorities said. U.S. officials then negotiated with foreign counterparts, ultimately producing a list of eight countries that were either unable or unwilling to provide the information the United States wanted. Sudan was dropped from the ban list, and its removal is noteworthy in part because it is one of just three countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. The other two, Iran and Syria, remain on the travel ban list. Chad, North Korea and Venezuela were added. Those in Chad, in particular, seemed surprised. \u201cThe reaction has been astonishment and then indignation,\u201d said Nour Ibedou, director of the Chadian Human Rights Association. \u201cWe do not understand how our country achieved this lack of trust from the United States.\u201d Administration officials can now point to Venezuela and North Korea as being non-Muslim majority countries on the banned list \u2014 perhaps undercutting the argument of opponents that the measure is meant to fulfill Trump\u2019s campaign promise of a Muslim ban. But ban opponents note that the restrictions on Venezuela affect only government officials and that few people from North Korea travel to the United States. [Almost no North Koreans travel to the U.S., so why ban them?] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the new ban was an \u201cunfounded strategy\u201d against the South American country. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for dialogue; we\u2019re looking for channels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop the madness and irrationality.\u201d If the Supreme Court case over the ban is declared moot, there could be disagreement on what happens next. The government wants the high court to vacate the two appellate court decisions that said Trump\u2019s executive order could not be enforced and the precedent that would come with them. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said the order violated federal law, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said Trump\u2019s ban was unconstitutional. There is precedent for the Supreme Court to vacate those rulings. In a 1950 ruling in a case called United States v. Munsingwear, the court held that where intervening mootness prevents review of a lower court\u2019s decision, that decision should be vacated. But challengers of the ban assert in their briefs that should not be the result in this case here. The ban could also face new legal challenges. But legal analysts said those suing would probably face immense hurdles. \u201cMy prediction is that given the importance of these powers, it\u2019s very likely that the court will hold that the new measure contains the type of rigorous analysis and measured policy choices necessary to pass constitutional muster,\u201d said Leon Fresco, who worked in the office of immigration litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department. \u201cAnd, I do not see the Supreme Court holding any part of this new directive unconstitutional.\u201d Kevin Sieff in Nairobi, Emily Rauhala in Hong Kong and Rachelle Krygier in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-09-25", "authors": ["robert.barnes.3139"], "type": "article", "author_string": "robert barnes"}, {"title": "Trump argues for revised travel ban by citing attacks carried out by U.S. citizens", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/01/trump-argues-for-revised-travel-ban-by-citing-attacks-carried-out-by-u-s-citizens/", "text": " President Trump speaks to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.

We have seen the attacks at home \u2014 from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center.\u201d [Trump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn\u2019t have prevented] Trump\u2019s comments implied that \u201cimproved vetting procedures\u201d would keep terrorists out. Yet the attacks he cited \u2014 the Boston Marathon bombing, the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., and the 9/11 attacks \u2014 were all carried out by U.S. citizens or people born in countries not included in his original ban and not expected to be included in the revised order. The male San Bernardino shooter was born in Illinois; his wife, with whom he carried out the attack, was born in Pakistan. (The FBI said the male gunman had been plotting attacks for years before he met her.) The Boston Marathon bombers were brothers born in Russia and Kyrgyzstan. Neither country was mentioned in Trump\u2019s original ban, nor are they expected to be on the revised version; the younger of the brothers, who was sentenced to death for the bombing, was a naturalized U.S. citizen. None of the 9/11 hijackers who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001 was from countries on the original ban list. Most were from Saudi Arabia, while the rest were from Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates. [Revised Trump immigration order, delayed after speech, will not ban citizens from Iraq] Trump\u2019s original travel ban barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen \u2014 as well as all refugees from entering the United States. The revised version is expected to lower that to six countries, removing Iraq from the list. There\u2019s also another problem with Trump\u2019s promise to \u201ckeep out those who would do us harm.\u201d Since the 9/11 attacks, every deadly jihadist attack inside the United States was carried out by a U.S. citizen or legal resident, according to New America, a Washington-based nonprofit group. \u201cFar from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents,\u201d the group said in a report on its findings. Although Trump\u2019s original order also froze refugee admissions, refugees from the seven countries in that ban have been responsible for no successful attacks in the United States between 1975 and 2015, according to a report published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. That, though, was before Abdul Razak Ali Artan, a refugee from Somalia, plowed his car into a crowd on the Ohio State University campus late last year, injuring 11. The FBI has alleged Artan might have been inspired by radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack. The chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee has alleged Artan should have received more thorough vetting when his family was seeking refu\u00adgee status in the United States years earlier. [New travel ban will exempt current visa holders, sources say] Still, Trump\u2019s comment that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of people convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 were not from the United States could be true, and the Justice Department backed him up in a statement Wednesday. \u201cSince 9/11, convictions have been obtained against over 500 defendants for terrorism or terrorism-related charges in federal courts,\u201d the department said. \u201cA review of that information revealed that a substantial majority of those convicted were born in foreign countries.\u201d A spokesperson said this list of people convicted includes everyone charged in a terrorism probe in that span, including those who plotted attacks and never carried them out as well as those who sought to travel overseas or fund terrorist groups abroad. The list also includes people facing charges that emerge from terrorism probes but were not specifically related to terrorism. Trump\u2019s comment and the department\u2019s statement do not specifically break out the countries implicated in the ban. The Department of Homeland Security, however, assessed that question specifically in a report analyzing the threat posed by those countries. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. (Luis Soto/AP) Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in March 2011, the report said, more than half of the 82 people who died in the pursuit of or were convicted of any terrorism-related offense inspired by a foreign terrorist organization were native-born U.S. citizens. That analysis was based on a review of Department of Justice press releases. Of the people who were convicted of or died in pursuit of terrorism, the review found eight were from the countries implicated in Trump\u2019s now-frozen travel ban, specifically Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Sudan and Yemen. None were from Syria. The report did not specifically mention Libya. [The government now says 746 people were held due to the travel ban. Here\u2019s why that number keeps changing.] Judges and others have expressed skepticism that the ban is necessary for national security reasons. U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said at a court hearing there was \u201cstartling evidence\u201d from national security professionals that the order \u201cmay be counterproductive to its stated goal\u201d of keeping the nation safe. Ten former high-ranking diplomatic and national security officials affixed their names to an affidavit declaring there was \u201cno national security purpose\u201d for a complete barring of people from the seven affected countries. But Trump and others have pressed the case. Trump claimed that the judge who froze the first ban \u201cput our country in such peril\u201d and warned that \u201cif something happens blame him and court system,\u201d strongly implying that the order was needed to avert a terrorist attack. Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly told a congressional committee it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that dangerous people were entering the United States with the order on hold, and that officials might not know until it was too late. \u201cNot until the boom,\u201d he said when asked during a House Homeland Security committee hearing whether he could provide evidence of a dangerous person coming into the country since the ban was suspended. It is unclear when Trump will sign the revised ban. He was originally expected to do so on Wednesday, but that was postponed after Trump\u2019s speech last night, the third time his administration has delayed the matter.

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Two federal judges have now blocked President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, and both cited extensively the president\u2019s own words \u2014 and those of his close advisers \u2014 as reasons they were convinced to do so. The comments, the judges said, provide strong evidence that the directive was meant to disfavor Muslims and thus violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Justice Department has argued that the comments should not be considered, because, in the department\u2019s view, the courts should not look beyond official statements and the order itself to determine its purpose. Informal statements to the media, they say, \u201cmay not accurately reflect the government\u2019s position.\u201d And statements on the campaign trail, they have asserted, are particularly irrelevant. \u201cThey generally are made without the benefit of advice from an as-yet-unformed Administration, and cannot bind elected officials who later conclude that a different course is warranted,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote in one court filing. So what is it that the president and his advisers have said that is now causing so much consternation? Here are seven examples that judges have cited as they have ruled against his new ban. [What\u2019s next for Trump travel ban 2.0] 1) \u201cA total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d A press release issued during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in December 2015 declared unequivocally, \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d The release \u2014 which was still available as of 1:27 p.m. Thursday on the campaign\u2019s website \u2014 also alleged a \u201cgreat hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.\u201d \u201cWhere this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine,\u201d Trump said in the release. \u201cUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.\u201d Judge Derrick K. Watson noted the press release in particular in his ruling Thursday that halted Trump\u2019s executive order, declaring there was nothing \u201cveiled\u201d about it. 2) \u201cHe said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 \u2026 Show me the right way to do it legally.\u201d Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a close Trump adviser during the campaign, appeared on Fox News Channel after the first travel ban was signed in January and claimed to know \u201cthe whole history of it.\u201d \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally,\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said. Watson cited that comment in his ruling, too, declaring it showed there was nothing \u201csecret\u201d about Trump\u2019s motive in issuing it. 3) \u201cThe same basic policy outcome for the country.\u201d After courts froze Trump\u2019s first travel ban, and he said he intended to issue a new one, policy adviser Stephen Miller spoke to Fox News Channel\u2019s Martha MacCallum about the possible revisions. \u201cWell, one of the big differences that you\u2019re going to see in the executive order is that it\u2019s going to be responsive to the judicial ruling, which didn\u2019t exist previously. And so these are mostly minor technical differences,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamentally, you\u2019re still going to have the same basic policy outcome for the country, but you\u2019re going to be responsive to a lot of very technical issues that were brought up by the court and those will be addressed. But in terms of protecting the country, those basic policies are still going to be in effect.\u201d That comment was particularly important because it connected the previous travel ban \u2014 which courts had frozen \u2014 to the new one, which Justice Department lawyers have argued was substantially different from the first. Watson cited it, too, as he asserted, \u201cThese plainly-worded statements, made in the months leading up to and contemporaneous with the signing of the Executive Order, and, in many cases, made by the Executive himself, betray the Executive Order\u2019s stated secular purpose.\u201d 4) \u201cYou could say it\u2019s an expansion.\u201d In July 2016, soon after he formally became the Republican presidential nominee, Trump was pressed in an interview on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on whether he was rolling back his proposed Muslim ban. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rollback. In fact, you could say it\u2019s an expansion. I\u2019m looking now at territories. People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can\u2019t use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I\u2019m okay with that, because I\u2019m talking territory instead of Muslim.\u201d In his ruling blocking a critical portion of Trump\u2019s new ban, U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang in Maryland cited that comment in particular. 5) \u201cWe all know what that means.\u201d As he signed his first travel ban, Trump told those gathered. \u201cAnd this is the protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means.\u201d He added, \u201cProtection of the nation from foreign terrorists\u2019 entry into the United States. That\u2019s big stuff.\u201d Chuang cited that comment, too, in his ruling. Though vague, it seemed to hint at the controversy over Trump\u2019s campaign-trail promise of a Muslim ban. And the next day, Giuliani\u2019s said on Fox News Channel that Trump used the phrase \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and asked him \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d \u201cIn particular, the direct statements by President Trump and Mayor Giuliani\u2019s account of his conversations with President Trump reveal that the plan had been to bar the entry of nationals of predominantly Muslim countries deemed to constitute dangerous territory in order to approximate a Muslim ban without calling it one \u2014 precisely the form of the travel ban in the First Executive Order,\u201d Chuang wrote. 6) Prioritizing Christians Earlier in the day he signed his first travel ban, Trump was asked by the Christian Broadcasting Network, \u201cAs it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d the president responded. He continued: \u201cDo you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d Trump\u2019s first executive order actually contained an exception to the section that barred refugees from entering the country for members of a religious minorities. Opponents pointed to that as evidence in the order itself that the measure was meant to disfavor Muslims, and the interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network seemed to offer more proof. The religious minority exception was removed from the revised executive order, but the two judges still highlighted the Christian Broadcasting Network interview in their rulings. 7) \u201cThe principles of the executive order remain the same.\u201d Trump signed his second travel ban out of public view on March 6, only to have administration officials \u2014 including the attorney general, homeland security secretary and secretary of state reveal it later. Later that day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, \u201cIf you think about it, the principles of the executive order remain the same.\u201d The administration has asserted that neither the new order nor the old one was a Muslim ban, but rather, a necessary pause in accepting refugees and travelers from certain countries for national security reasons. The judges, though, were apparently unpersuaded. After noting Spicer\u2019s comment, Chuang declared that the mere removal of the religious exception did not \u201ccure\u201d the executive order of its constitutional problems, and asserted: \u201cCrucially, the core policy outcome of a blanket ban on entry of nationals from the Designated Countries remains. When President Trump discussed his planned Muslim ban, he described not the preference for religious minorities, but the plan to ban the entry of nationals from certain dangerous countries as a means to carry out the Muslim ban.\u201d", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-03-16", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Analysis | 4 claims the Trump White House made about its travel ban that now look silly", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/06/3-claims-trump-made-about-his-travel-ban-that-dont-hold-up-at-all/", "text": "The nations affected by President Trump's executive action on immigration are not actually countries where terrorists who have carried out fatal attacks the United States came from. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) President Trump on Monday took his second crack at a travel ban executive order. He signed a scaled-back version of the previous executive order, which was halted by the courts, that does more to guard against the idea that it is a thinly veiled \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and excludes Iraq from the list of banned countries. Whether the new ban passes legal muster is one question \u2014 and it will undoubtedly be answered in pretty short order. But as much as anything, the handling of the new executive order makes some of Trump's actions and claims surrounding the first ban appear particularly haphazard and disingenuous. Trump and his aides said many things about the need for the last executive order that simply don't hold up anymore. Below, we review a few of them. 1) CLAIM: The travel ban simply could not wait. REALITY: The revised ban was originally due almost two weeks ago -- and was reportedly delayed for political reasons. When Trump signed the first executive order one week into his presidency \u2014 and implementation over that first weekend went poorly, even according to many Republicans \u2014 the White House justified it by saying that it was an urgent need and couldn't wait. But it has been almost a month since the last one was halted. And as The Fix's Callum Borchers wrote last week, both Politico and CNN reported that this new order was delayed for political purposes: Asked in a Jan. 30 interview on MSNBC why Trump had moved so quickly to sign the order, press secretary Sean Spicer said \u201cthere was a very short period of time in which we had something to execute that ensured that the people of the United States were safe.\u201d Spicer clarified that U.S. intelligence agencies had not detected a specific threat but said: \u201cDo you wait until you do? The answer is you act now to protect the future.\u201d The new answer seems to be that the White House will act when the media moment is right. Trump had planned to unveil a revised order on Wednesday but held off amid a wave of largely positive coverage of his address to Congress Tuesday night. Politico, citing unnamed administration officials, reported that the president didn't want to divide the media's attention. \u2026 In a similar report, CNN quoted an unnamed official who said the White House wanted the new order \u201cto have its own moment.\u201d 2) CLAIM: You can't give notice of the ban's implementation date. REALITY: The new ban gives a 10-day notice. Here's what Trump said after the first ban's rough implementation weekend, amid questions of why it couldn't have been delayed by a few days while agencies figured out how to deal with it: If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 Apparently that prospect no longer applies. The new travel ban has a 10-day period before it will take effect on March 16. So those \u201cbad\u201d \u201cdudes\u201d have not only had a month to enter the country since the last ban was struck down, but they'll now have 10 more days to game the system knowing exactly what's coming. (Unless Trump's claim was all bluster.) 3) CLAIM: The White House would appeal the initial ruling and wouldn't rescind the first travel ban. REALITY: The White House is rescinding the first travel ban. Trump said after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the temporary restraining order on his first ban, \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT.\u201d SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 White House press secretary Sean Spicer, meanwhile, told reporters Feb. 21 that the initial travel ban wouldn't be rescinded when the replacement was signed. QUESTION: One more clarification just before you go. So, when the new EO comes out, you won't rescind the original one, you'll leave it in place? SPICER: That's correct. Both were wrong. That appeal still hadn't come as of Monday, and the new executive order rescinds the first travel ban effective on the date that the new one will be implemented: March 16. On March 16, the initial EO will be revoked. https://t.co/ORAfcfXCxn pic.twitter.com/9wn1qrVHj4 \u2014 Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) March 6, 2017 4) CLAIM: The first ban's implementation process was silky smooth. REALITY: The administration says the new implementation process won\u2019t be so rocky this time. When the media reported on the chaos as airports the first weekend that the travel ban was in effect, the White House dismissed these reports completely (even as Republicans complained): Their overarching message: Everything is going exactly according to plan, nothing has changed since the order was signed, and the news media need to calm down their \u201cfalse, misleading, inaccurate, hyperventilating\u201d coverage of the \u201cfractional, marginal, minuscule percentage\u201d of international travelers who have been simply \u201cset aside for further questioning\u201d for a couple hours on their way into the greatest country in the world. \u201cIt really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level,\u201d the administration official said at one point. In describing the new executive order, though, a Department of Homeland Security official acknowledged the chaotic rollout and said it would be avoided. (The official did qualify this statement with \"alleged chaos.\") \u201cYou should not see any chaos, so to speak, or alleged chaos, at airports. There aren\u2019t going to be folks stopped tonight from coming into the country because of this executive order. If they are, it\u2019s pursuant to our ordinary screening procedures,\u201d the anonymous DHS official said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very smooth implementation period.\u201d", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "authors": ["aaronblakewp"], "type": "article", "author_string": "aaron blake"}, {"title": "The Trump team bizarrely quibbles with calling its travel ban a \u2018ban\u2019 \u2014 and then backs down", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/31/trumps-team-is-mad-people-are-calling-the-travel-ban-a-ban-even-though-they-also-called-it-a-ban/", "text": "During the White House daily briefing on Jan. 31, NBC's Kristen Welker asked press secretary Sean Spicer why the administration is lashing out against calling President Trump's executive order on immigration a \"travel ban,\" when that's in fact what the president is calling it on Twitter.

When the tweet above was pointed out at Tuesday's briefing, Spicer insisted Trump was just \u201cusing the words that the media is using.\" (We assume the press secretary would say he was doing the same thing himself Monday.) \u201cBut it can't be ... a ban if you're letting a million people in, if 325,000 people from another country can't come in,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThat, by nature, is not a ban.\u201d NBC's Kristen Welker asked if the message was getting confused. \u201cI'm not confused,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThe words that are being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling it.

In its memo announcing Acting Attorney General Sally Yates's firing late Monday, the White House seemed to take issue with that adjective. \u201cCalling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme,\u201d the memo reads. Okay, on this latter one, maybe they get a pass. They seem to be saying that although the vetting will be \u201cextreme,\u201d the policy itself isn't (?). It's still very mixed messaging. But the first one just doesn't make sense. If it's so wrong to call this a travel \u201cban,\u201d the White House's three leading public messengers should know not to call it that. They both did ... on Monday. That's Political Messaging 101. And although it's perhaps understandable that Trump would goof and use the wrong word, Spicer knows better. If avoiding the word \u201cban\u201d was the strategy, he wouldn't have used it Monday. And we would have seen pushback on its use earlier than five days after the ban was enacted.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) A new poll has good news and bad news for President Trump. The good news is that his image rating has edged up a little bit. The bad news is that reviews of his controversial travel ban have gone the opposite direction. The Quinnipiac poll shows Trump's favorable/unfavorable split at 42/52 \u2014 slightly better than the 39/52 it showed two weeks ago. But even as his image hasn't eroded, his signature and controversial executive order has somewhat. Quinnipiac has polled the travel ban three times: In late November, January and today. And while in both previous polls the general concept had more supporters than opponents, the new poll shows it's now underwater: 44 percent support and 50 percent opposition. That six-point gap is reversed from a month ago, when it was favored 48-42. The new poll echoes pretty much everything we've seen since the travel ban was signed and implemented. A CNN poll showed people opposed it 53-47 percent. CBS showed it trailing 51-45. And Gallup had it 55-42 for the opposition. That's very consistent, no matter what Trump says about the polls. Part of the reason people have come to oppose it could certainly be the rocky rollout. Whatever you think of the actual policy, its implementation had even many Republicans speaking out publicly. And separately, the order has legal problems, with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday reviewing a judge's decision to temporarily halt it. [Federal appeals court weighs Trump immigration order] But here's another possible reason the ban isn't earning support: The timing. Trump has been wielding a bullhorn to warn about the imminent threat of radical Islamic terrorism coming across the border in recent months. But Americans are actually less concerned than they've been in years about domestic terrorism. And the kind of terrorism they most fear has nothing to do with immigration or refugees; it's homegrown extremists. The Q poll shows just 27 percent of people believe it is \u201cvery likely\u201d there will be a terrorist attack in the United States in the immediate future. That's down from 47 percent in December 2015 \u2014 the last time this issue was polled. And it's the lowest it's been in Quinnipiac polling since May 2011 \u2014 a span of six polls. That 47 percent, it bears noting, came weeks after the terrorist attacks in Paris and then San Bernardino, Calif. So it's understandable that fears about domestic terrorism were heightened at the time. But that's also kind of the point: Fear of terrorism is much more real at some points than others. And for whatever reason, right now is not one of those points when Americans are hugely worried about domestic terrorism. The only time they've been less worried in the last decade, in fact, was after the killing of Osama bin Laden \u2014 another example of how current events impact these fears. But wait a minute, Trump supporters might say, perhaps that is because of Trump! Maybe people suddenly feel safe because he's president and will finally get tough on terrorism. Perhaps his travel ban is already putting fears to rest. It's possible, but it's also true that people don't seem to sympathize with Trump's view that terrorists could be streaming into the United States through our immigration and refugee admittance programs. The Q poll asked whether people feared Syrian refugees, radicalized visitors or \u201chomegrown jihadists\u201d the most, and 56 percent chose the last option \u2014 vs. 31 percent combined for Syrian refugees and other outsiders entering the United States. That suggests that Trump's travel ban was, in some ways, a solution in search of a problem \u2014 at least in the minds of many Americans. And that may be tempering support amid a rough rollout process. To be clear: This is not a hugely unpopular policy. Americans are pretty split on it right now, actually, with Republicans in favor (84-11) and Democrats opposed (84-10). Independents are slightly against, 53-40. But through poor implementation, timing and over-the-top messaging \u2014 from the original \u201cMuslim ban\u201d to the strong rhetoric Trump has used more recently \u2014 it seems to have turned a potentially popular idea into something more divisive and ill-received.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-02-08", "authors": ["aaronblakewp"], "type": "article", "author_string": "aaron blake"}, {"title": "Federal appeals court maintains freeze of Trump\u2019s travel ban.

The broad, decisive ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit means the Trump administration still cannot enforce its travel order that the government says is urgently needed for national security. Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court. In a 10-to-3 decision, the Richmond-based court said the president\u2019s power to deny entry into the United States is not absolute and sided with challengers, finding that the travel ban \u201cin context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\u201d The president\u2019s authority, the court said, \u201ccannot go unchecked when, as here, the president wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation,\u201d according to the majority opinion written by Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory and joined in part by nine colleagues.

(Steve Helber/AP) The 4th Circuit order leaves in place a nationwide injunction issued in March by U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang in Maryland, who sided with opponents in finding that the ban violates the Constitution by intentionally discriminating against Muslims. Thursday\u2019s ruling means citizens from Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya can continue entering the United States. [Judges press Trump\u2019s lawyers in travel ban case on campaign statements] Even if the appeals court had sided with the Trump administration, the president\u2019s order would have remained on hold because of a separate opinion from a federal judge in Hawaii. To put the ban in motion, the Justice Department would also have had to win at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, which heard oral arguments on May 15 in the government\u2019s appeal of the Hawaii decision. Federal immigration law gives the president broad authority, and acting solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall had urged the court to defer to the president and not second-guess his judgment. But the ruling from the 4th Circuit was the latest in a series of defeats for the administration. Trump rewrote the entry ban after the 9th Circuit in February refused to lift an earlier injunction. The revised version would temporarily suspend the U.S. refugee program and halt for 90 days the issuance of new visas to travelers from the six countries while the administration reviews its screening process. [Read the full 4th Circuit opinion on President Trump's travel order] If the administration asks the Supreme Court to stay the 4th Circuit\u2019s decision, the request usually requires showing that the government would suffer irreparable harm if the lower court decision was allowed to stand. The passage of time since the executive order was first issued might make that difficult. Sessions said the administration \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with Thursday\u2019s decision but did not detail its strategy except to say that the government \u201cwill seek review\u201d of the ruling. The president\u2019s order, Sessions said in a statement, is \u201cwell within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe,\u201d and the president is \u201cnot required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States.\u201d A challenge would go to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who receives emergency petitions from that court, and then be referred to the rest of the justices. It would take five votes to stay the decision. [9th Circuit rules 3 to 0 against Trump on first version of travel ban] The challenge in Maryland was brought by organizations and individuals, including a Muslim in the United States whose relative would be affected by the ban. In its 79-page opinion, the court said challengers had demonstrated the harm that would come from delaying or disrupting pending visa applications, in addition to the \u201cpsychological harm that flows from confronting official action preferring or disfavoring a particular religion.\u201d Karen Tumlin, the legal director at the National Immigration Law Center and one of the lawyers on the case, said the court concluded that the president\u2019s order has to be blocked because it \u201csteps over the constitutional line in a way that is out of step with our constitutional values of religious tolerance.\u201d During oral arguments this month, many of the 4th Circuit judges questioned the government\u2019s lawyer about the link between U.S. security and the barring of citizens from the six countries identified by the administration. In its opinion Thursday, the court said, \u201cplaintiffs point to ample evidence that national security is not the true reason\u201d for the order, \u201cincluding, among other things, then-candidate Trump\u2019s numerous campaign statements expressing animus towards the Islamic faith\u201d and his proposal as a candidate to ban Muslims from entering the United States. A key issue for the court was whether to consider the president\u2019s political statements and whether the order violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment that specifically prohibits the government from denigrating a particular religion. The travel order itself makes no mention of religion or Muslims. The majority opinion recounts in detail Trump\u2019s statements, and it quotes extensively from his tweets, media interviews and comments made by his supporters and advisers, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer. \u201cLaid bare, this executive order is no more than what the president promised before and after his election: naked invidious discrimination against Muslims,\u201d Judge James A. Wynn Jr. wrote in a concurring opinion. Judge Stephanie D. Thacker also sided with the majority but said the court could reach the same conclusion without relying on Trump\u2019s comments before he became president. All of the judges in the majority were nominated to the court by Democratic presidents, and the three dissenting judges \u2014 Paul V. Niemeyer, Dennis W. Shedd and G. Steven Agee \u2014 were nominated to the bench by Republican presidents. Niemeyer called the decision unprecedented and unworkable. \u201cThe Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds,\u201d Niemeyer wrote. \u201cOne that transforms the majority\u2019s criticisms of a candidate\u2019s various campaign statements into a constitutional violation.\u201d Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-05-25", "authors": ["robert.barnes.3139"], "type": "article", "author_string": "robert barnes"}, {"title": "Judge in Maryland will weigh Trump travel ban the day before it takes effect", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/judge-in-maryland-will-weigh-trump-travel-ban-the-day-before-it-takes-effect/2017/03/10/dd175406-05cc-11e7-b1e9-a05d3c21f7cf_story.html", "text": "A federal judge in Maryland will hear arguments on President Trump\u2019s new travel ban the day before the measure is set to take effect.

Judge Theodore D. Chuang scheduled a hearing on the new ban for March 15 at 9:30 a.m., less than 24 hours before administration officials say they will begin enforcing it. Unless another court takes action before that, the date could be a significant one. A federal judge in Hawaii also is slated to hear arguments at 3:30 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday on whether he should immediately block Trump\u2019s order, which suspends the U.S. refu\u00adgee program and temporarily bars the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries. The state of Washington, supported by several other states, separately has asked a federal judge in Seattle to declare that his freeze on Trump\u2019s original ban applies to the new one. If the judge does so, that could obviate the need for more hearings, said Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project and a lawyer in the Maryland case. Another group in Washington also has sued to immediately block the new ban, and a judge ordered the parties to participate in a telephone hearing Monday to lay out a schedule. \u201cAt this point, we are seeking an injunction because we have no idea whether the Seattle injunction will remain in place,\u201d Gelernt said. \u201cWhat we are hoping is that the Seattle judge will continue the injunction nationwide. If he does that before the 15th, then there may not be a need for urgent action on our part.\u201d Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) said Friday that his state would join Washington state\u2019s lawsuit. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. The hearing scheduled for Wednesday in Greenbelt stems from a lawsuit brought by the International Refugee Assistance Project and HIAS Inc., a refu\u00adgee resettlement group. Both sued over the president\u2019s first travel ban, which temporarily barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States and suspended the refu\u00adgee program. The new ban is different from the old in significant ways. It reduces the number of affected countries from seven to six \u2014 removing Iraq, while keeping Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria. It also applies only to the issuance of new visas, instead of revoking visas from those who already have them. Several states and civil liberties groups, though, have said the new order suffers from the same legal problems as the first one because it discriminates against Muslims under the guise of being a national security measure. In deciding whether to suspend the new ban, federal judges will have to weigh the extent to which it differs from the first and whether it imposes immediate harms. More than 130 former U.S. officials, including former Secretary of State John F. Kerry, sent an open letter to the Trump administration Friday saying the revised executive order has the same defects as the previous version, and will weaken national security and undermine U.S. leadership. The letter was signed by officials who worked in Democratic and Republican administrations going back to President Reagan, and included many of the same well-known names who signed a Jan. 30 letter objecting to the original ban on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority nations. But the latest letter was signed by even more people, many of whom served under President Obama and President George W. Bush. They included cabinet secretaries, ambassadors, members of Congress and generals. \u201cBans like those included in this order are harmful to U.S. national security and beneath the dignity of our great nation,\u201d said the letter, addressed to five senior Trump administration officials. \u201cWe must remain vigilant to keep our nation safe from terrorists, whether foreign or homegrown,\u201d the letter states at another point. \u201cAt the same time, we must remain true to our ideals.\u201d", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-03-10", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Federal judge declines to immediately apply freeze of first Trump travel ban to new order", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/10/federal-judge-declines-to-immediately-apply-freeze-of-first-trump-travel-ban-to-new-order/", "text": " U.S. District Judge James L.

The decision from U.S. District Judge James L. Robart is a modest blow to the state of Washington, which had sued over the ban, because the quickest path to success would have been getting the judge to declare that Trump\u2019s new order was affected by the freeze the judge imposed previously. But Robart declined to do that only for procedural reasons and did not address the merits of any arguments. [Washington state asks judge to declare that freeze of first Trump travel ban applies to new order] Neither side, Robart wrote, had filed a motion for him to consider, and the state\u2019s previous complaints were directed at an executive order that is now revoked. \u201cAccordingly, the court also declines to resolve the apparent dispute between the parties concerning the applicability of the court\u2019s injunctive order to the New Executive Order until such time as an amended complaint that addresses the New Executive Order is properly before the court,\u201d Robart wrote.

(James Lawler Duggan/Reuters) The Trump administration is considering replacing a part of its controversial travel ban with more-tailored restrictions that could vary from country to country, officials announced Friday. Officials declined to say precisely what those restrictions will be, which countries they might affect or even when the president will put them into effect. The key portion of Trump\u2019s travel ban, which bars the issuance of visas to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries, is set to expire Sunday. Trump\u2019s travel ban had always been contemplated as a temporary measure, designed to give officials time to assess vetting procedures and the information other countries were able or willing to provide. Officials of the Department of Homeland Security had quietly been conducting that assessment and recently delivered to the White House a critical, classified report on their findings. [White House receives DHS report that will shape travel ban\u2019s future] Miles Taylor, counselor to acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, said Duke recommended that the president impose restrictions that are \u201ctough\u201d but \u201ctailored.\u201d He said the measures ultimately put in effect might vary from place to place, and they could be lifted if countries meet U.S. demands for information and other security measures. \u201cQuite frankly, the screening and vetting status quo for border and immigration security is not adequate,\u201d Taylor said. Officials said Trump had not made a final decision, and they did not say when he would. White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said there were \u201ccontingency plans\u201d if the ban were to expire without new restrictions being in place. The assistant secretary for consular affairs at the State Department, Carl C. Risch, said he expected the State Department to issue guidance to those in the field next week. The latest measures would mark the third iteration of Trump\u2019s effort to restrict entry of foreign travelers to the United States. His original travel ban, signed in January, blocked citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and Syria \u2014 as well as all refugees across the globe. When that measure was blocked in court, Trump signed a revised order removing Iraq from the banned list and only barring the issuance of visas to citizens of the six remaining countries and all refugees. The second order, too, was blocked by judges, but the Supreme Court in June allowed it to go into effect with a significant caveat. The administration, the court said, could not block those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as family members or those with firm offers of employment, from entering the country. The ban on citizens of the six countries was to last 90 days; the ban on refugees was to last 120 days. The refu\u00adgee ban is set to expire Oct. 24, and it was not immediately clear what impact the new restrictions might have on it. The Supreme Court has scheduled arguments for Oct. 10 on whether the measure, at its core, is legal. It is unclear how any new restrictions might affect that case, and it is possible that they could spark fresh legal challenges. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said the department was continuing to defend the executive order but could not comment on the ongoing litigation. In assessing vetting procedures, U.S. officials established a new \u201cbaseline\u201d for the information officials want about foreigners hoping to come to the United States, Taylor said. In July, he added, the United States communicated that new baseline to countries across the world. Many countries, he said, already met U.S. requests \u2014 using secure biometric passports, for example, and willingly passing along terrorism and criminal-history information. Others agreed to make changes and share more data. But some were either unable or unwilling to give the United States what it needed, Taylor said. He said those are the countries that are likely to face restrictions, although the restrictions could be lifted if conditions changed. Officials declined to say what new restrictions were being considered, or whether citizens of any country could still be banned outright from U.S. entry. They also declined to say how many countries might face restrictions \u2014 although Taylor said more than six initially did not at first provide the United States with the necessary information. Citing an attack in London, Trump last week seemed to call for an expansion of the travel ban, writing on Twitter, \u201cThe travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\u201d A Homeland Security spokesman said this week, though, that the intention of the department\u2019s recommendation to the White House was \u201cnot to create a ban of any sort.\u201d", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-09-22", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Grandparents, other extended relatives exempt from Trump travel ban, federal judge rules", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/grandparents-other-extended-relatives-exempt-from-trump-travel-ban-federal-judge-rules/2017/07/14/ce67aa72-6888-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html", "text": "Grandparents and other extended relatives are exempt from President Trump\u2019s travel ban, a federal judge in Hawaii declared late Thursday, again stopping the administration from implementing the president\u2019s controversial executive order in the way that it wants.

Watson wrote that the government\u2019s \u201cnarrowly defined list\u201d of who might be exempt was not supported by either the Supreme Court decision partially unfreezing the ban or by the law. \u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cIndeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members.

In the meantime, Department of Homeland Security and State Department spokesmen said their agencies were reviewing the decision with the Justice Department, and working on implementation of Watson\u2019s decision. At issue is how far the administration can go in keeping out relatives of U.S. residents under the president\u2019s travel ban, which temporarily bars entry for all refugees and the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and \u00adYemen. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) The Supreme Court ruled late last month that the government could begin enforcing the measure, but not against those with \u201ca credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States. The court offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify. \u201cClose familial\u201d relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \u201cformal, documented and formed in the ordinary course.\u201d The administration said it would let into the United States from the six affected countries parents, parents-in-law, siblings, spouses, children, sons and daughters, fiances, and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law of those already here. Still banned, however, were grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. And the administration also said it would keep out refugees who had a formal assurance from a resettlement agency. The state of Hawaii, which has been suing over the travel ban, soon asked Watson to intervene. The district judge had initially ruled against Hawaii in the case, telling it to go straight to the Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit also rebuffed the state\u2019s request, although it offered a way forward: Watson, the appeals court said, would have jurisdiction over a reframed request. Hawaii then filed such a request, setting up Watson\u2019s ruling Thursday \u2014 which allows the entry of those the government had wanted to keep out. Hawaii Attorney General Douglas S. Chin said in a statement: \u201cThe federal court today makes clear that the U.S. government may not ignore the scope of the partial travel ban as it sees fit. Family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough. Courts have found that this Executive Order has no basis in stopping terrorism and is just a pretext for illegal and unconstitutional discrimination. We will continue preparing for arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in October.\u201d While the Supreme Court partially unfroze Trump\u2019s travel ban, it did so only temporarily, indicating it would truly take up the case in the fall.

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) U.S. officials can at least temporarily continue to block refugees with formal assurances from resettlement agencies from entering the United States after the Supreme Court intervened again Monday to save a piece of President Trump\u2019s travel ban. Responding to an emergency request from the Justice Department, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy stopped an earlier federal appeals court ruling that had allowed refugees with a formal assurance to enter the country. Kennedy, who handles cases on an emergency basis from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, ordered those suing over the ban to respond by noon Tuesday, and he indicated that the appeals court ruling in their favor would be stayed \u201cpending receipt\u201d of their response. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision came not long after the Justice Department asked the justices to act. That filing, by Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall, demonstrated the lengths to which the government is willing to go to impose its desired version of the ban, even before the high court takes up in earnest next month whether the measure is lawful at its core. At issue is whether the president can block a group of about 24,000 refugees with assurances from entering the United States after the Supreme Court decided in June to permit a limited version of his travel ban to take effect. [Grandparents, refugees with formal assurances can enter under Trump\u2019s travel ban, appeals court rules] President Trump's travel ban has been challenged in court at every turn. Now the Supreme Court is allowing a limited version to take effect, but with an expanded list of familial exemptions. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Since Trump signed his first travel ban shortly after taking office, the directive has been mired in a complicated legal battle. The president ultimately revoked the first ban \u2014 which blocked refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States \u2014 and replaced it with a less onerous version that blocked refugees and citizens of six of the initial seven countries. The Supreme Court ultimately decided Trump could impose that measure, but not on those with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as having family members here, a job or a place in a U.S. university. It is the interpretation of a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States that is being debated. The government initially sought to block grandparents and other extended family members of people in the United States from entering \u2014 as well as refugees with formal assurances \u2014 though a federal district judge stopped from doing so. The Supreme Court in July largely upheld that ruling, though it put on hold the portion dealing with refugees. Last week, a federal appeals court panel weighed in, deciding that the administration could block neither grandparents nor refugees with assurances. [Supreme Court allows Trump refugee ban but backs broader exemptions for relatives] The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to step in again \u2014 though only to block refugees, not grandparents and other extended family members. Even those refugees with formal assurances from a resettlement agency lack the sort of connection that should exempt them from the ban, the Justice Department argued in its filing to the Supreme Court. \u201cThe absence of a formal connection between a resettlement agency and a refugee subject to an assurance stands in stark contrast to the sort of relationships this Court identified as sufficient in its June 26 stay ruling,\u201d Wall wrote in his filing. \u201cUnlike students who have been admitted to study at an American university, workers who have accepted jobs at an American company, and lecturers who come to speak to an American audience, refugees do not have any free-standing connection to resettlement agencies, separate and apart from the refugee-admissions process itself, by virtue of the agencies\u2019 assurance agreement with the government.\u201d The Supreme Court on June 26 decided to allow a limited version of President Trump\u2019s travel ban to be implemented. The court will also hold a hearing on the case in the fall. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Neal Katyal, a lawyer representing the state of Hawaii, which is challenging the travel ban, wrote on Twitter that he would \u201cfight\u201d the government\u2019s latest request. The government said the battle is urgent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had said its ruling allowing refugees with resettlement agreements would take effect Tuesday, which Wall asserted could be disruptive. \u201cThe government began implementing the Order subject to the limitations articulated by this Court more than two months ago, on June 29, which entailed extensive, worldwide coordination among multiple agencies and the issuance of guidance to provide clarity and minimize confusion,\u201d Wall wrote. Time is beginning to become a factor in the broader fight over Trump\u2019s travel ban. The measure was supposed to have been temporary \u2014 lasting 90 days for citizens of the six affected countries, and 120 days for refugees. If the measure is considered to have taken effect when the Supreme Court allowed a partial ban, the 90 days will have passed by the time the justices hear arguments Oct. 10, and the 120 days are very likely to have passed by the time they issue a decision. Some deadlines for reports have also seemingly passed. The Department of Homeland Security secretary was \u2014 within 20 days of the order taking effect \u2014 to have given Trump the results of a worldwide review determining what information was necessary from other countries to vet travelers. The countries that weren\u2019t supplying adequate information were then to be given 50 days to begin doing so, and after that, top U.S. officials were to give Trump a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a more permanent travel ban. A Homeland Security spokesman said a report was delivered to the White House in early July on the results of the review, and officials then went about assessing each country based on the information it provided. \u201cSome provided more, some things were cleared up, and others weren\u2019t,\u201d David Lapan, the spokesman, said. \u201cNow we have a comprehensive understanding of the information we receive from all foreign partners.\u201d He said Homeland Security officials were \u201cevaluating the information received and will provide a report to the president in the coming weeks.\u201d A State Department spokeswoman said Monday that the department was \u201cengaging with foreign governments to meet these new standards for information sharing\u201d but could not \u201cprejudge the outcome of this engagement.\u201d \u201cWe recognize that many governments will need time to meet any new standards, and we will work to assess and, where necessary, work with foreign governments to design a plan to provide the information requested,\u201d the spokeswoman said.

That is because the high court effectively allowed Trump to ban from coming to the United States only citizens of six majority-Muslim countries \u201cwho lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d It also nudged the president to complete his promised review of vetting procedures, which might mean the issue is resolved by the time the court is set to fully consider the ban in its October term. For now, if you are not a U.S. citizen and have a relative here, have been hired by a U.S. employer or admitted to an American university, you can still probably get a visa.

[Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect, will consider case in fall] \u201cThe facts of these cases illustrate the sort of relationship that qualifies,\u201d the court said in an unsigned opinion. \u201cFor individuals, a close familial relationship is required. A foreign national who wishes to enter the United States to live with or visit a family member \u2026 clearly has such a relationship. As for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading [the executive order].\u201d (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) The justices wrote that an immigration-rights nonprofit group could not simply add a foreign national to a client list just so that person could travel to the United States. They said the same standard would apply to refugees wanting to come to the country, and those with U.S. connections would effectively be exempt from the 50,000-refu\u00adgee cap the ban sought to impose. There could, of course, be disputes. In a dissenting opinion that said the travel ban should have been allowed to take effect in full, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote that the decision would \u201cprove unworkable.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding \u2014 on peril of contempt \u2014 whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country,\u201d Thomas wrote. [Trump\u2019s big travel ban win? Let\u2019s not get carried away.] When Trump issued his first travel ban, chaos ensued. The State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas, and some travelers were detained and sent away from U.S. airports, prompting a flurry of legal challenges. That will not be the case since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Trump had revised and rewritten his executive order, and it now affects only the issuance of new visas to people from six Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and Syria. That means no one should be blocked at a U.S. airport but rather will simply be denied a visa. Leon Fresco, deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department, said that in some ways the court\u2019s ruling restores long precedent. \u201cIt has never been the case for 100 years that someone can simply sue us for not getting a visa,\u201d he said. [Supreme Court sides with religious institutions in a major church-state decision] But Fresco said the decision also puts pressure on the administration to review its vetting procedures \u2014 and possibly end the ban. That\u2019s because the administration has posited the ban as a temporary measure, designed to alleviate officials\u2019 \u201cinvestigative burdens\u201d while they assessed what information they need about travelers coming to the United States. The visa ban was supposed to last 90 days, the refu\u00adgee ban 120 days. In the interim, the homeland security secretary was to have asked the affected countries to provide information about their citizens\u2019 requests for U.S. visas, review the data and report to the president which countries could not adequately comply. But the administration said it felt blocked by a U.S. district judge from even conducting such a review. Trump signed a memorandum earlier this month indicating that the order would take effect within 72 hours of when the injunctions on his ban were lifted or stayed. The Supreme Court wrote that the government now should be able to do its work. \u201cWe fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments within the 90-day life of [the order],\u201d the justices wrote. The court said it would take up the travel ban fully in its October term; their ruling Monday only partially lifted lower courts\u2019 stays on the measure. By that time, the 90-day period will have run, and Fresco said the administration will be pressed to come up with good reasons for imposing a ban. \u201cIf there is not an answer to the question on the first day of oral arguments about why this ban is still in place, that is going to make the court much more skeptical about the government\u2019s reasons for having this ban,\u201d Fresco said.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-06-26", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "White House receives DHS report that will shape travel ban\u2019s future", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-receives-dhs-report-that-will-shape-travel-bans-future/2017/09/19/47cc3d76-9d57-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html", "text": "The Department of Homeland Security has submitted to the White House a classified report on screening foreign travelers wanting to enter the United States \u2014 a key document President Trump is likely to rely on as he decides the future of his controversial travel ban. With a major portion of the ban set to expire Sunday, DHS officials in recent days sent a report to the White House that \u201cmeets the requests that the president laid out in the executive order in an effort to establish better screening and vetting of persons to the United States,\u201d department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said. Hoffman declined to say exactly what the report recommended, although he asserted it was not meant to form the basis of a permanent ban. Last week, citing an attack in London, Trump had written on Twitter that his ban should be \u201cfar larger, tougher and more specific.\u201d [Citing London terrorist attack, Trump calls for expansion of his travel ban] \u201cThe intention of it is not to create a ban of any sort,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cIt is to ensure that we have the ability to screen and vet people traveling to the United States.\u201d Trump\u2019s travel ban \u2014 which barred the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries and blocked the entry of all refugees \u2014 was contemplated as a temporary measure, designed to give DHS officials time to assess the information the United States is able to get about those coming to the country. The portion of the ban affecting citizens of the six countries was to expire in 90 days, and the portion affecting refugees was to expire in 120 days. The 90-day period expires Sunday, according to spokesmen for the Justice Department and DHS. [Which of your family members could visit under the travel ban] While the ban was in effect, DHS and other officials were to assess the information other countries provided to the United States to help with vetting. Those countries that could not produce the necessary information or come up with a plan to do so were to be included on a list sent to the president. Those on the list risked being named in \u201ca Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals,\u201d according to Trump\u2019s executive order. Hoffman declined to say whether the report to the president included such a list, although he said it was created in response to the executive order\u2019s demand for one. He also declined to say what officials will do after Sunday, referring questions on that subject to the White House. \u201cEverybody is aware of the timeline, and we are focused on ensuring that persons traveling to the United States are properly vetted and screened before coming here, regardless of where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d he said. The White House declined to comment on the future of the ban, offering only that the administration would \u201censure we only admit those who can be properly vetted and will not pose a threat to national security or public safety.\u201d The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Oct. 10 on whether the travel ban is legal. In the meantime, officials have been allowed to impose only a limited version of the measure, exempting those with a bona fide connection to the United States, such as a job or family member here. The refu\u00adgee portion of the ban is set to expire Oct. 24, U.S. officials have said, probably before the Supreme Court will have made a decision.

A three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against the administration unanimously. Their ruling is another blow to Trump \u2014 although the administration has asked the Supreme Court to to step in and save the ban in a different case. [Trump\u2019s latest tweets will probably hurt effort to restore travel ban] Trump fired back Tuesday in a tweet, saying the 9th Circuit \u201cdid it again\u201d by ruling against the travel ban \u201cat such a dangerous time in the history of our country.\u201d As in some previous tweets, Trump wrote out \u201cTRAVEL BAN\u201d in all capitals. He ended the message with \u201cS.C.\u201d \u2014 a reference to a possible Supreme Court hearing on the executive order. The ruling by the 9th Circuit was both logistically and symbolically important \u2014 keeping in place the broadest blockade on Trump\u2019s order and creating legal and practical paths for the directive to die. Unlike other courts in the past, the three judges did not dwell on Trump\u2019s public comments, nor did they declare that the president had run afoul of the Constitution because his intent was to discriminate. Instead, they ruled that the travel ban lacked a sufficient national security or other justification that would make it legal, and that violated immigration law. They offered no opinion on whether the ban was constitutional. \u201cThere is no finding that present vetting standards are inadequate, and no finding that absent the improved vetting procedures there likely will be harm to our national interests,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cThese identified reasons do not support the conclusion that the entry of nationals from the six designated countries would be harmful to our national interests.\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that he disagreed with the court\u2019s decision and that the president was within his authority to issue the order. \u201cRecent attacks confirm that the threat to our nation is immediate and real,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cPresident Trump knows that the country he has been elected to lead is threatened daily by terrorists who believe in a radical ideology, and that there are active plots to infiltrate the U.S. immigration system \u2014 just as occurred prior to 9/11. The President is committed to protecting the American people and our national security, and we are proud to support his mission to put America first by defending his right to keep us safe. That is why the Department of Justice will continue to seek further review by the Supreme Court.\u201d Neal Katyal, one of the lawyers representing those challenging the ban, said on Twitter that the decision was a \u201ccomplete win\u201d and noted it was different from previous victories in other cases. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit had upheld a separate freeze on Trump\u2019s ban on constitutional grounds, that freeze did not apply to the portion of Trump\u2019s order dealing with refugees. The 9th Circuit was considering a freeze that did, and concluded that Trump had not provided sufficient justification to either temporarily suspend refu\u00adgee admission or lower the refu\u00adgee cap for fiscal 2017 to 50,000. The opinion also clarified that the administration could conduct an internal review to assess vetting procedures. That could be construed as a victory for Trump: The appeals court said a federal judge in Hawaii was wrong to restrict his administration from conducting such a review. But Hawaii, which had successfully challenged the ban, earlier in the day had told the Supreme Court it had no objection to such a move. \u201cThe executive is free to engage in any manner of study, review, upgrade or revision of its existing vetting procedures,\u201d the state argued, adding, \u201cso long as the order did not use these provisions to justify or expand a veiled Muslim ban, they would survive judicial review.\u201d If the travel ban is to be salvaged, the Supreme Court would have to move quickly. [Trump proposed a 120-day travel ban to improve vetting. It\u2019s been 129 days.] That is because the measure is supposed to be temporary \u2014 barring the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspending the U.S. refu\u00adgee program for 120 days so officials could review vetting procedures. The Justice Department had said it felt blocked from conducting a review by the Hawaii judge, meaning the clock had essentially stopped. That clock will presumably now run again, though whether it will start from 90 or something short of that remains unclear. With a Supreme Court recess looming, the ban could expire before the justices reach a decision \u2014 unless they grant the Justice Department\u2019s request to stay the injunctions on the ban. Trump seemed to suggest on Twitter recently, though, that he viewed the measure not as a temporary one. \u201cPeople, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\u201d he wrote last week. Trump\u2019s press secretary had previously disputed calling the measure a ban, and the Justice Department has sought in court to characterize it as a \u201ctemporary pause.\u201d Most Supreme Court practitioners and experts said they would be surprised if the court turned down a petition from the government on a matter of national security \u2014 though the justices might feel less pressure to come to a decision on the merits of the executive order before the end of June. In a filing with the court Monday concerning the 4th Circuit decision, ACLU lawyer Omar C. Jadwat said the administration had shown by its actions that there was no immediate danger to the country in not having the travel ban in place. And he argued there is a \u201clooming mootness\u201d question because no court has stayed the executive order in its entirety. Jadwat asserted the order is set to expire June 14. The ACLU filing said the 4th Circuit, and other courts that have halted the executive order, had little choice. \u201cTo allow the ban to go forward, the courts would have had to ignore a mountain of publicly available evidence \u2014 even though everyone else in the country, including those of the disfavored faith, could not ignore it. They would have had to set aside this Court\u2019s precedents and turn their backs on their traditional and crucial role in disputes where constitutional liberties are at stake.\u201d The 9th Circuit opinion was written by judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard A. Paez, all appointed by President Bill Clinton. They heard arguments in the case last month and focused much of their questioning on the president\u2019s campaign trail and other public comments, which other judges have cited as evidence the president meant to discriminate against Muslims in imposing a ban. Trump earlier this month doubled down on some of those comments, deriding the revised travel ban as a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of the first and calling the new measure \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d Legal analysts said that might ultimately hurt his case; one tweet was cited in a footnote in Monday\u2019s opinion. In their ruling, though, the 9th Circuit judges criticized the Trump administration not for its public opining, but for its lack of a real justification for the directive. The latest version of the ban \u2014 which Trump signed after revoking an order that banned residents of seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 describes conditions in the countries affected and says that more than 300 people who entered the country as refugees were the subject of active counterterrorism investigations. [Trump administration\u2019s latest rationale for travel ban: National security officials asked for it] The judges noted that a Department of Homeland Security report concluded citizenship was an \u201cunreliable\u201d threat indicator, and most foreign-born extremists are radicalized years after coming to the United States. The judges said the president had broad authority to set immigration policy, but it was \u201cnot unlimited.\u201d \u201cIn conclusion, the Order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cNational security is not a \u2018talismanic incantation\u2019 that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power.\u201d The 9th Circuit was the court that upheld the freeze on Trump\u2019s first travel ban, and it has since become a focus of the president\u2019s ire. When U.S. District Judge William Orrick blocked his executive order on stripping federal funding from sanctuary cities, Trump incorrectly attributed the decision to the 9th Circuit as he wrote on Twitter: \u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities \u2014 both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!\u201d Orrick is a \u00adlower-court judge whose rulings would be reviewed by the 9th Circuit. Trump then wrote that the circuit had a \u201cterrible record of being overturned\u201d \u2014 a claim that is highly debatable \u2014 and he said later that he had \u201cabsolutely\u201d considered breaking up the court.

U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson scheduled a hearing for March 15 at 3:30 p.m. Eastern time to hear arguments on the state of Hawaii\u2019s latest legal challenge to the order. Hawaii late Wednesday formally filed its lawsuit asking Watson to block the executive order. The 38-page complaint asserts that the new executive order \u2014 much like the old \u2014 violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment because it is essentially a Muslim ban, hurts the ability of state businesses and universities to recruit top talent and damages the financial interests of the state, which considers tourism its lead economic driver. [Hawaii plans to sue to block new Trump travel ban] \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Executive Order is antithetical to Hawaii\u2019s State identity and spirit,\u201d lawyers for the state wrote. \u201cFor many in Hawaii, including State officials, the Executive Order conjures up the memory of the Chinese Exclusion Acts and the imposition of martial law and Japanese internment after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.\u201d Trump\u2019s new travel ban is substantially revised from its original version, and those who sue over it will probably have a harder time getting it \u00adimmediately frozen by the courts. They will have to convince judges that there is an urgent need to do so and that, in the long term, Trump will probably be found to have run afoul of the First Amendment. The new order reduces the list of affected countries from seven to six \u2014 removing Iraq while keeping Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria. It explicitly exempts legal permanent residents and current visa holders, blocking only the issuance of new visas for citizens of the affected countries for 90 days. It also spells out a lengthy list of people who may be eligible for exceptions, including those previously admitted to the United States for \u201ca continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity\u201d; those with \u201csignificant business or professional obligations\u201d; and those seeking to visit or live with family. The new order keeps intact a 120-day suspension of the refu\u00adgee program, and it declares that the United States will not accept more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal 2017, down from the 110,000 cap set by the Obama administration. It will take effect March 16 unless a court intervenes before then. [What Trump changed in the new travel ban] In its lawsuit, Hawaii argues that foreign residents and \u00adtravelers contribute substantially to the functioning of the state, and blocking even the issuance of new visas would have a major impact. State lawyers wrote that Hawaii is home to 12,000 foreign students, and at least 27 \u00adgraduate students are from the seven countries affected by the original ban. In 2016, lawyers for the state wrote, Hawaii\u2019s foreign students contributed more than $400 million to Hawaii\u2019s economy with tuition and fees, living expenses and other activities. The lawyers also said that tourism was a driver of Hawaii\u2019s economy, and that 8.7 million visitors \u00adaccounted for $15 billion in spending in 2015. [Trump\u2019s new travel ban raises the same Silicon Valley objections] As others did with the first travel ban, Hawaii is still \u00adpointing to campaign trail comments by Trump indicating that he wanted to impose a blanket ban on Muslims as evidence that the order violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. U.S. officials have disputed that characterization. Justice Department lawyers have asserted that a short-term freeze is especially unnecessary, because the new ban only applies to the issuance of new visas, a process that can take months. In its court filing, the state pointed to the case of Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii, whose mother-in-law\u2019s application for an immigrant visa was still being processed. Under the new executive order, lawyers for Hawaii said, Elshikh feared that his mother-in-law would ultimately be banned from entering the United States. That could be true, and Elshikh, a U.S. citizen, would have better standing to sue in U.S. courts than a noncitizen. But Justice Department lawyers might point to the waiver process as a way the imam\u2019s mother-in-law could enter the country. The state of Washington had successfully convinced a U.S. district judge and a three-judge appellate panel that economic harms imposed by Trump\u2019s first ban presented a need to \u00adimmediately order the measure suspended.

(Mike Segar/Reuters) Three federal appeals court judges on the West Coast dealt President Trump a critical blow last week when they refused to reinstate his controversial executive order barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country. Their ruling means that \u2014 at least for the foreseeable future \u2014 people can travel as they could before the ban existed. How long that will last, though, remains an open question \u2014 largely dependent on what the administration decides to do in and out of court. Here are the four options it is considering. [Federal appeals court rules 3 to 0 against Trump on travel ban] 1) Rewrite the order Trump said himself last week that he\u2019s considering rewriting his ban, even as he predicted success in court. He said the revisions might include \u201cnew security measures,\u201d though he did not offer any specifics. Given the ruling of the three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, Trump would likely have to change his order top-to-bottom to pass legal muster. He could make clear that it no longer applies to green-card holders \u2014 who probably have the strongest case to sue in U.S. courts \u2014 or he could craft an order that applies only to people who have not yet applied for visas. But the three-judge panel said even those modifications would not necessarily make them change their minds, because such changes would not help U.S. citizens who \u201chave an interest in specific noncitizens\u2019 ability to travel to the United States.\u201d Importantly, Trump\u2019s ban was mostly designed to be temporary: 90 days for citizens of Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya, 120 days for refugees from everywhere, and an indefinite suspension on citizens of Syria. In the meantime, the administration was supposed to be looking at how to improve vetting procedures. It\u2019s possible Trump could sign an order that lays out those vetting procedures and declares the travel ban is no longer necessary. Provided those procedures are legal, that would probably be his best bet for dodging litigation \u2014 though it\u2019s hard to imagine how officials could have come up with the new measures so quickly. The executive order was only signed on Jan. 27. 2) Play for a legal win in the long-run The three-judge panel\u2019s ruling \u2014 while undeniably important \u2014 was not the last word on whether Trump\u2019s order can pass constitutional muster. In fact, the judges noted they were taking no position on whether the order ran afoul of the Constitution and discriminated against Muslims. When they handed down their ruling, they actually set a schedule for a full briefing on the matter, with the last filing due on March 29. The Justice Department, which is representing the Trump administration, could simply choose to fight it out in the appeals court and in the various courthouses across the country where similar lawsuits have been filed. They might have better success with courts addressing the issues more squarely. The Justice Department lawyers had an uphill battle with the three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit. A lower-court judge had already suspended the ban, and they had to convince the panel that national security interests necessitated that they immediately lift the suspension. In the long run, they would likely only have to prove that there was a rational basis for Trump imposing his order and that it was not meant to discriminate against Muslims for their religion. A long-term win, though, might be more symbolic than practical. By the time the courts finally decide squarely on the issues, the ban will possibly have expired. And it\u2019s hard to square how the administration could acquiesce to that given the president\u2019s assertions on Twitter about the short-term danger of the ban being frozen. Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 3) Try to get the full appeals court to weigh in Without the administration doing anything, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit asked that the court consider whether it should reconsider the three-judge panel\u2019s ruling on an \u201cen banc\u201d basis. That is where a bigger collection (in the 9th Circuit, it\u2019s the chief judge and 10 others) take arguments and then decide whether to uphold or overturn the panel\u2019s decision. The Justice Department and the states of Washington and Minnesota, which are suing over the ban, have until Thursday to file briefs on whether they think the matter should be considered en banc. After that, the appeals court judges will vote on whether to rehear the case. If they decide to hear it, an oral argument will be scheduled. Taking this route would not preclude the administration from playing for the win in the long-run, though it might slow that process down. Justice Department lawyers seem to at least be considering it, as they asked a U.S. District Court judge in Washington Monday to postpone his own proceedings until there was some action from the 9th Circuit. Source: U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington 4) Go to the Supreme Court The Justice Department could still rush to have the Supreme Court intervene and reinstate the ban in the short term. Not long after the 9th Circuit panel issued its ruling, Trump seemed to preview that option, tweeting, \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\u201d SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Friday that a Supreme Court bid is still on the table, moments after another White House official indicated otherwise. That said, it\u2019s looking increasingly unlikely. For starters, the Justice Department let the entire weekend and most of Monday pass without asking the Supreme Court to intervene. They would, of course, need time to prepare a request to the nation\u2019s highest court, but each day that passes shows their willingness to slow things down and allow the ban to remain frozen. Justice Department lawyers on Monday also indicated they wanted to see whether the 9th Circuit would hear the case en banc before announcing what action they thought was appropriate in a lower court. That would seem to be an indication they do not intend to take the case to the Supreme Court \u2014 at least not until they see whether the 9th Circuit will hear the case en banc. The Supreme Court now has only eight members, and it is seen as being ideologically split 4 to 4. If the Justice Department were to rush to them now and get a tie, that would keep intact the appeals court ruling and effectively hand the Trump administration another loss.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-02-13", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Judge rejects Hawaii bid to exempt grandparents from Trump\u2019s travel ban", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/judge-rejects-hawaii-bid-to-exempt-grandparents-from-trumps-travel-ban/2017/07/06/8e3a3252-625d-11e7-8adc-fea80e32bf47_story.html", "text": "Grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States are not exempt from President Trump\u2019s travel ban, a federal judge effectively decided Thursday as he denied a bid to curtail enforcement of the executive order meant to keep out citizens of six Muslim-majority countries.

Watson wrote that he would not \u201cusurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court,\u201d and if those suing over the ban wanted relief, they should take their claims there. That means the government, at least for now, can use the travel ban to block citizens of the affected countries if they are the grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law of people in the United States. Officials can also block refugees with a formal assurance from a resettlement agency. The administration had wanted to keep such people out, and thought a recent Supreme Court ruling partially lifting lower courts\u2019 freezes on the travel ban allowed them to do so. But those who had sued over the ban disagreed, and they asked Watson to intervene \u2014 which he declined to do. [Travel ban takes effect as State Department defines \u2018close family\u2019] \u201cBecause Plaintiffs seek clarification of the June 26, 2017 injunction modifications authored by the Supreme Court, clarification should be sought there, not here,\u201d Watson wrote. Neal Katyal, a lawyer for those challenging the ban, noted on Twitter the ruling offered no decision on the \u201cmerits of dispute,\u201d but simply said it was the Supreme Court\u2019s place to decide. The Supreme Court had ruled late last month that the government could begin enforcing the measure, but not on those with \u201ca credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States. The court offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify. \u201cClose familial\u201d relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \u201cformal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.\u201d The government put the measure into effect on June 29, suspending the refu\u00adgee program and barring the issuance of new visas to residents of Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Syria without U.S. connections. But for opponents of the ban, the administration\u2019s interpretation of who had a connection was too narrow. The administration said it would let into the United States from the six affected countries parents, parents-in-law, siblings, spouses, children, sons and daughters and sons-in-law and daughters-in-law of those already here. (Officials initially wanted to keep out fiances, but later relented.) Still banned, though, were grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. And the administration also said it would keep out refugees that had a formal assurance from a resettlement agency. [What the Supreme Court\u2019s travel ban ruling means] Hawaii, which had initially sued over the ban, objected in court, asking Watson to clarify that such people could not be blocked. \u201cThe Government does not have discretion to ignore the Court\u2019s injunction as it sees fit,\u201d lawyers representing the state wrote. The government shot back that it was drawing lines on who counted as a close family member based on its interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Justice Department lawyers asserted that the Supreme Court had made clear not all people with U.S. connections should be allowed in. \u201cAs the Supreme Court instructed, not all relationships with a person in the United States suffice to fall outside the stay and within the injunction,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote. \u201cIndeed, not even all familial relationships suffice; rather, a \u2018close familial relationship\u2019 is required.\u201d The matter is likely bound for higher courts. The government had asked Watson to put his ruling on hold pending \u201can immediate request to the Supreme Court for clarification of its ruling,\u201d and even those suing agreed that any disputes remaining after Watson\u2019s order \u201cshould be dealt with through expedited appellate review.\u201d The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the fall on whether Trump\u2019s travel ban can pass legal muster. So far, it has only temporarily blocked lower courts\u2019 injunctions. Some of the justices predicted there might be problems before that. Justice Clarence Thomas, in an opinion joined by justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M.

(Andrew Harnik/AP) The Trump administration is finalizing a revised travel ban that exempts current visa holders, according to people familiar with the matter. The revision marks a significant departure from the now- frozen first executive order, which temporarily barred citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and all refugees from entering the United States and resulted in the State Department revoking tens of thousands of visas. Justice Department lawyers hope the new order will be more likely to withstand legal challenges and will not leave any travelers detained at U.S. airports. The new order also removes an exception to the refu\u00adgee prohibition for religious minorities, one person said. Critics of the order had said that that exception proved the order was meant to discriminate on the basis of religion, because it allowed only Christians into the country. The new order, the details of which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, was expected to be signed Wednesday, but the White House canceled that after Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday night. The people who described it to The Washington Post did so on the condition of anonymity because the administration had not authorized the release of details. The people said that the situation is fluid and that changes are still possible. There will be a period between when the order is signed and when it takes effect, in hopes of avoiding the problems that occurred when the last order was implemented. While blocking only the issuance of new visas marks a substantial change, analysts have said that this would not necessarily be enough for the order to pass legal muster. Spokesmen for the White House, Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security declined to comment for this report. A federal district judge in Washington state first suspended the travel ban Feb. 3, and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit later upheld that freeze. The Justice Department has since asked the courts to hold off on further litigation while a new executive order was crafted, although the Court of Appeals told the parties to press ahead with the case. While that has been ongoing, refugees as well as people from the seven affected countries have been able to enter the United States subject to normal individual screenings on arrival. The president has broad authority to set immigration policy, although Trump\u2019s first executive order was implemented in such a way that most judges agreed that the directive \u2014 or at least aspects of it \u2014 should be suspended. Judges have yet to weigh whether the ban is constitutional. Trump and his top spokesmen have asserted that they feel they are on strong legal footing, despite short-term losses. The White House counsel already had clarified that the ban did not apply to legal permanent residents, although courts have said they could not rely on that assertion because it was a separate statement and not part of the executive order. Officials hope the new executive order will allay that concern and also reduce the number of plaintiffs who have the right to sue. Even that, though, might not go far enough. The 9th Circuit panel that ruled the ban should remain frozen said such a revision would not address claims \u201cby citizens who have an interest in specific noncitizens\u2019 ability to travel to the United States.\u201d That, analysts have said, might be referring to the foreign wife of a U.S. citizen who is seeking a visa. A spokesman for Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had successfully sued to freeze the ban, said, \u201cOur current stance is to wait and see the particulars, which could make all the difference.\u201d Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who is involved in a separate legal challenge, said, \u201cIf the new executive order contains a ban, we believe it is unconstitutional religious discrimination and will therefore continue our legal challenges.\u201d The administration must also contend with comments the president and top allies and his advisers have made, which could serve as evidence that the ban was intended to discriminate on religious grounds. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d And after the election, former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said: \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d A federal judge in Virginia referenced those comments in ordering the ban frozen with respect to Virginia residents and institutions, calling it \u201cunrebutted evidence\u201d that Trump\u2019s directive might violate the First Amendment. That is important, because if judges found that even the new order was designed to discriminate against Muslims \u2014 and not to protect national security \u2014 they might similarly strike it down. Justice Department lawyers will have to try to convince judges that there is a national security reason for the ban and that it is not a tool for discrimination. That the new order will not include an exception for religious minorities \u2014 which had been seen as a way to get only Christians into the country \u2014 is likely to bolster the government\u2019s case, particularly if Justice Department lawyers persuade the judiciary to look mostly at the executive order itself for evidence of the administration\u2019s purpose. But analysts said the new order cannot wash away completely the stains of the old one \u2014 especially after senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said that the revised version would have \u201cmostly minor technical differences\u201d and that Americans would see \u201cthe same basic policy outcome for the country.\u201d And the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis recently produced a report casting doubt on the need for the executive order, concluding that citizenship of a particular country is an \u201cunreliable\u201d threat indicator and that people from the seven countries named in the original ban have rarely been implicated in U.S.-based terrorism.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-02-28", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Revised Trump immigration order, delayed after speech, will not ban citizens from Iraq", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/after-saying-dangerous-people-may-be-pouring-into-our-country-trump-has-repeatedly-put-off-inking-new-travel-ban/2017/03/01/6f3ca47e-fe86-11e6-8f41-ea6ed597e4ca_story.html", "text": "President Trump arrives on Capitol Hill for his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. After the speech went well, the White House scrapped plans for a new travel ban Wednesday. (Jim Lo Scalzo/Associated Press) President Trump\u2019s new executive order on immigration will not include a blanket ban on citizens from Iraq, among a host of other revisions meant to allay legal and diplomatic concerns, people familiar with the matter said. The White House late Tuesday scrapped plans for Trump to sign a revised travel ban Wednesday afternoon, a person familiar with the matter said, marking the third time the administration has put off the matter since the president said that dangerous people might enter the country without a prohibition in place. But when it is signed, people familiar with the matter said, the order is still expected to include a host of significant changes. The order will exempt current visa holders and legal permanent residents, and it will not impose a blanket ban on those from Iraq, where U.S. forces are working with the Iraqis to battle the Islamic State. It will not include an exception for religious minorities, which critics had pointed to as evidence it was meant to discriminate against Muslims. And it will not go into effect immediately when it is signed, people familiar with the matter said. The people said the situation remains fluid and changes remain possible. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria, said he, too, had heard Iraq would not be included in the revised order, though he also had heard the opposite. Asked if he had concerns about Iraq\u2019s possible inclusion in the new executive order, he praised the country as \u201cour partner and ally.\u201d \u201cThey are protecting us here, and we\u2019re fighting this enemy that threatens all of our countries together,\u201d Townsend said. Earlier, he had said the Iraqis\u2019 reaction to the first ban was \u201cpretty level-headed and sophisticated,\u201d and that the security forces with whom he dealt \u2014 while \u201crelieved when the executive order was suspended\u201d \u2014 remained focused on their mission. \u201cNow they\u2019re waiting to see how that may play out here in the future,\u201d Townsend said of the new executive order. The decision to delay signing the order came as people on Twitter and elsewhere heaped praise on Trump for his speech Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress. A CNN-ORC poll, for example, showed that 7 in 10 people who watched said the address made them feel more optimistic about the direction of the country, and about two-thirds said the president has the right priorities for the nation. The pool of those who watched the speech was about eight points more Republican than the total population. It was not immediately clear why the White House canceled plans to ink the new executive order, although CNN reported that a White House official did not deny that optics were part of the calculus. \u201cWe want the [executive order] to have its own \u2018moment,\u2019 \u201d an official told the network. A White House spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment for this article. [New travel ban will exempt current visa holders, sources say] Trump\u2019s original executive order, now frozen by the courts, had temporarily barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Yemen \u2014 and all refugees from entering the United States. When it was implemented, the State Department provisionally revoked tens of thousands of visas, and some people who were in transit when it took effect were detained or deported once they reached U.S. airports. Although courts have disagreed, the president has insisted that the ban is necessary for national security reasons. He wrote on Twitter that, because a federal judge in Washington state had ordered it frozen, \u201cmany very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country.\u201d He also suggested that if something were to happen, the court system would be to blame. Since then, the Justice Department has asked courts to delay litigation while a new order is drafted, and the White House has repeatedly put off doing that. The president said on Feb. 10, a Friday, that he was considering writing a new order and that he probably would take some action the following Monday or Tuesday. He did not write a new order by then, and on Feb. 16, a Thursday, he said he would do so the following week. Again, he did not, and a senior administration official said on Feb. 22 that the order would be delayed another week, as officials worked to make sure it would be implemented smoothly. The president was slated to sign the order Wednesday, but now, it seems, it will have to wait again. How long is unclear. The delays and the removal of Iraq from the list of blocked countries could undermine the administration\u2019s argument about the necessity of the ban. In arguing that the ban should not be frozen, the Justice Department had asserted that the seven countries, including Iraq, covered by the order were identified by Congress and the previous administration as having problems with terror. Judges and others had already been skeptical of the argument that the administration needed to impose a ban for national security reasons. U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said at a court hearing there was \u201cstartling evidence\u201d from national security professionals that the order \u201cmay be counterproductive to its stated goal\u201d of keeping the nation safe. A recent Department of Homeland Security report concluded citizenship is an \u201cunreliable\u201d threat indicator and that people from the seven countries affected by the ban have rarely been implicated in U.S.-based terrorism. Of 82 people \u201cwho died in the pursuit of or were convicted of any terrorism-related federal offense\u201d since March 2011, that report said, more than half were U.S.-born citizens. and just two were from Iraq. The president said Tuesday night that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside the United States. The Justice Department said in a statement Wednesday that it had won convictions \u201cagainst over 500 defendants for terrorism or terrorism-related charges in federal courts,\u201d and a \u201creview of that information revealed that a substantial majority of those convicted were born in foreign countries.\u201d A department spokeswoman declined to provide the raw data. The administration already has faced criticism for pointing to terror attacks that the ban could not have prevented as evidence of its necessity, and critics noted it omitted Saudi Arabia, which is where most of the Sept. 11 hijackers came from. Now Justice Department lawyers might be pressed to justify why people from Iraq can enter the United States, when those from other countries with the same designation cannot.

The court issued a one-paragraph statement granting the administration\u2019s request for a stay of the latest legal maneuvering involving the president\u2019s executive order on immigration. There were no recorded dissents to the decision. At issue is whether the president can block a group of about 24,000 refugees, who have assurances from sponsors, from entering the United States. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had interpreted a Supreme Court directive this summer to mean that such refugees should be allowed in, but the government objected. The latest court actions are part of a complicated legal battle that began in January when President Trump issued his first version of an entry ban. The Supreme Court is to consider the merits of his actions at a hearing Oct. 10. The current case grows out of a Supreme Court decision in June that approved a limited version of a presidential order that temporarily blocked refugees and citizens of six majority-Muslim countries. President Trump's travel ban has been challenged in court at every turn. Now the Supreme Court is allowing a limited version to take effect, but with an expanded list of familial exemptions. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) [Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect and will consider case in fall] The justices said Trump could impose a limited version of the measure, but not on a person with a \u201cbona fide\u201d connection to the United States, such as having family members here, a job offer or a place in a U.S. university. It is the interpretation of a \u201cbona fide\u201d tie to the United States that is being debated. The government initially declined to include grandparents and other members of the extended family as meeting that standard, as well as refugees with formal assurances. A federal district judge said the government\u2019s reading was too broad and stopped it. The Supreme Court largely upheld that ruling in July, although it put on hold the portion dealing with refugees. [Supreme Court allows Trump refugee ban but backs broader exemptions for relatives] Last week, a panel of the 9th Circuit weighed in, deciding that the administration could block neither grandparents nor refugees with assurances. The Justice Department this week asked the Supreme Court to step in again \u2014 although only to block refugees, not grandparents and other relatives beyond the nuclear family. Even those refugees with formal assurances from a resettlement agency lack the sort of connection that should exempt them from the ban, the Justice Department argued in its new filing to the Supreme Court. \u201cThe absence of a formal connection between a resettlement agency and a refugee subject to an assurance stands in stark contrast to the sort of relationships this court identified as sufficient in its June 26 stay ruling,\u201d acting solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall wrote in his filing. \u201cUnlike students who have been admitted to study at an American university, workers who have accepted jobs at an American company, and lecturers who come to speak to an American audience, refugees do not have any free-standing connection to resettlement agencies, separate and apart from the refugee-admissions process itself, by virtue of the agencies\u2019 assurance agreement with the government,\u201d the filing said. In response, the state of Hawaii, which is challenging the entry ban, told the Supreme Court that the government\u2019s argument made no sense. \u201cRefugees with formal assurances are the category of foreign nationals least likely to implicate the national security rationales the government has pointed to in the past,\u201d wrote Washington lawyer Neal Katyal, who is representing Hawaii. \u201cBy the government\u2019s own admission, these refugees have already been approved by the Department of Homeland Security. It is therefore exceedingly unlikely that they represent a security threat.\u201d Time is beginning to become a factor in the broader fight over Trump\u2019s entry ban. The measure was supposed to have been temporary \u2014 lasting 90 days for citizens of the six affected countries, and 120 days for refugees. If the measure is considered to have taken effect when the Supreme Court allowed partial implementation, the 90 days will have passed by the time the justices hear arguments Oct. 10, and the 120 days are very likely to have passed by the time they issue a decision. Some deadlines for reports have also seemingly passed. The Department of Homeland Security secretary was \u2014 within 20 days of the order taking effect \u2014 to have given Trump the results of a worldwide review determining what information was necessary from other countries to vet travelers. The countries that were not supplying adequate information were then to be given 50 days to begin doing so, and after that, top U.S. officials were to give Trump a list of countries whose citizens would be recommended for inclusion in a more permanent travel ban. A Homeland Security spokesman said that a report was delivered to the White House in early July on the results of the review and that officials then went about assessing each country on the information it provided He said Homeland Security officials were \u201cevaluating the information received and will provide a report to the president in the coming weeks.\u201d", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-09-12", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Washington state asks judge to declare that freeze of first Trump travel ban applies to new order", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/washington-state-will-ask-judge-to-declare-that-freeze-of-first-trump-travel-ban-applies-to-new-order/2017/03/09/c64d54f0-04fa-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html", "text": "Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who sued successfully to block President Trump\u2019s first entry ban, asked a federal judge Thursday to affirm that the suspension of the initial ban applies to the new one.

And he said a federal judge, rather than the administration, should decide whether the original freeze should remain in place. \u201cThe court decides that,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cnot the president.\u201d Ferguson, a Democrat, made his request to U.S. District Judge James L. Robart, the federal judge in Washington state who first suspended Trump\u2019s ban nationwide. After Robart imposed that freeze, Trump lashed out on Twitter and targeted Robart personally. [Revised executive order bans travelers from six Muslim-majority countries from getting new visas] \u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump wrote. The state of Hawaii already has asked a federal judge there to block Trump\u2019s new executive order, which bars the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the refu\u00adgee program for 120 days. A hearing in that case is set for March 15. Robart could presumably act before that, and it is possible that other legal challenges will emerge. Ferguson \u2014 who sued initially with the state of Minnesota \u2014 is expected to be joined by other states, including New York, Oregon and Massachusetts. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman dropped out of a case in that state Thursday to be a part of the effort in Washington. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s latest executive order is a Muslim Ban by another name, imposing policies and protocols that once again violate the Equal Protection Clause and Establishment Clause of the United State Constitution,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. [Why Hawaii says Trump\u2019s new travel ban is still unconstitutional] The first ban affected seven countries and the refu\u00adgee program, and the administration implemented it by revoking tens of thousands of visas and detaining people as they landed at U.S. airports. The new ban specifically exempts current visa holders and spells out a robust list of people who could be granted waivers as they apply for new visas. Justice Department lawyers have said that the administration plans to enforce the measure on March 16, unless a court tells them otherwise. Pursuing the case in Washington state might have strategic advantages, as both Robart and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit \u2014 which is where the case could head after his decision \u2014 have previously ruled against the administration on the travel ban.

On the campaign trail, Trump promised a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the United States, and the three judges with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit specifically asked about how much they should consider that and other statements in deciding the future of the president\u2019s executive order. The hearing was important in its own right to the future of the travel ban but was made even more interesting because Trump has repeatedly criticized the 9th Circuit for ruling against him. [7 things Trump and his advisers have said about the travel ban that wound up hurting them in court] Judge Michael Daly Hawkins asked a Justice Department lawyer whether Trump had \u201cever disavowed his campaign statements,\u201d and Judge Ronald M.

A different court \u2014 the 9th Circuit \u2014 took up another challenge Monday. (Steve Helber/AP) Judge Richard A. Paez noted that many of Trump\u2019s statements on the matter were made \u201cin the midst of a highly contentious campaign\u201d and asked those suing over the ban, \u201cIf we don\u2019t consider the campaign statements, do you still prevail?\u201d He did, however, deem the campaign trail comments \u201cprofound.\u201d Trump\u2019s travel ban \u2014 key sections of which have been frozen by two courts \u2014 tried to temporarily shut down the U.S. refu\u00adgee program and suspend the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries. Those challenging the ban say it is unconstitutional because it was motivated by Trump\u2019s desire to discriminate against Muslims, and they point to Trump\u2019s comments and those of his advisers as evidence to prove their case. The Justice Department argues that the executive order is well within the president\u2019s purview and that lower courts have been wrong to second-guess him on a matter of national security. The panel of three 9th Circuit judges \u2014 all appointed by President Bill Clinton \u2014 will join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in deciding the fate of the ban. To fully reinstate the measure, the Justice Department would have to win in both the 4th and 9th circuits \u2014 or escalate the dispute to the Supreme Court. [President Trump\u2019s lawyers on revised travel ban repeatedly asked about campaign promises] On Monday, acting solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall told the judges that they need only determine whether there was a \u201crational basis\u201d for the president\u2019s travel ban, and if they thought there was some bad intent, they should focus on official, unequivocal statements as evidence. Wall argued that the president had said \u201cseveral things approaching\u201d a repudiation of his campaign trail comments, in that he had \u201cclarified that what he was talking about were Islamic terrorist groups and the countries that shelter or sponsor them.\u201d But the judges, he said, should nonetheless tread lightly in weighing political remarks. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t start down the road of psychoanalyzing what people meant on the campaign trail,\u201d Wall said. Pressed at the daily briefing Monday about whether the president would repudiate his previous comments, White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to answer specifically but insisted that the ban was \u201cfully lawful and will be upheld.\u201d \u201cRight now, the president is making sure that we make the appropriate arguments to get the ban in place,\u201d Spicer added. Lawyer Neal Katyal, arguing the case on behalf of those who sued over the ban, said the judges should simply ask themselves \u201cwhat would an objective observer think, with these sorts of statements.\u201d Katyal noted that when Trump signed the first version of his travel ban, which he later revoked and rewrote, the president read the title and commented, \u201cWe all know what that means\u201d \u2014 a post-campaign hint of a discriminatory intention. And after a court blocked the revised order, Katyal said, Trump declared the new measure a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version of the first. Pressed by Paez on whether the order would be constitutional if it was signed by someone who had not made such comments, Katyal quipped, \u201cIf you don\u2019t say all these things, you never wind up with an executive order like this.\u201d Katyal allowed, though, that the president would not be forever barred from issuing a similar executive order, if he were to repudiate his previous comments or take other actions to prove that his intent was not to discriminate. The 9th Circuit blocked Trump\u2019s first travel ban, though the revised version is before a different panel. The 4th Circuit, which is based in Richmond, heard arguments on the matter last week. Their decision and the 9th Circuit\u2019s probably won\u2019t come for weeks. Last week, a federal judge in Michigan ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other advisers \u2014 whose comments judges nationwide have pointed to as they have ordered the ban frozen. That case is separate from the two that have put Trump\u2019s latest ban on hold. [All the times Trump personally attacked judges \u2014 and why his tirades are \u2018worse than wrong\u2019] Trump has not been shy about criticizing judges who rule against him, but he seems to have particular ire for the 9th Circuit. When U.S. District Judge William Orrick blocked his executive order on stripping federal funding from sanctuary cities, Trump incorrectly attributed the decision to the 9th Circuit as he wrote on Twitter: \u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities \u2014 both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!\u201d Orrick is a \u00adlower-court judge whose rulings would be reviewed by the 9th Circuit.

That case, which stems from a federal district court in Maryland, is farther along, and the judges will likely decide next week whether to put the ruling by a lower court judge against the travel ban on hold. The appeal notice in the 9th Circuit comes a day after U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson maintained his freeze on Trump\u2019s travel ban by taking the technical step of converting his temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction. That injunction offers a more permanent block of Trump\u2019s ban, although it also allows the Justice Department to ask a higher court to intervene. An ultimate decision on the ban likely remains weeks away, and to get the ban restored fully, the Justice Department must either win in both appeals courts or persuade the Supreme Court to intervene. It is unclear exactly how soon that could happen. A hearing in the 4th Circuit is scheduled for May 8.

On Wednesday, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland will hear arguments on whether to halt Trump\u2019s revised executive order, which suspends the U.S. refu\u00adgee program, temporarily bars the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries and slashes refu\u00adgee admissions to the United States this fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000. Late Tuesday, the federal judge in Seattle who stopped Trump\u2019s first entry ban was to review legal briefs in that case. \u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d said Peter Lavallee, spokesman for the Washington state attorney general\u2019s office, which filed the lawsuit in Seattle with the support of several other states. \u201cWe\u2019ll just wait to see what happens.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union and others have called Trump\u2019s orders discriminatory, while federal officials say the actions seek to protect the United States from terrorism. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Jayne Orenstein,Alice Li/The Washington Post) U.S. District Judge James L. Robart had ordered Trump administration lawyers to submit a brief by 4:30 p.m. Pacific time Tuesday in the Seattle lawsuit. He could rule that his injunction on the ban remains in effect, despite changes in the revised order. Either way, lawyers said the hearing in Greenbelt, Md., will be critical to the part of the executive order that deals with refu\u00adgee programs, because Robart\u2019s ruling did not apply to that section. Refugee rights organizations in the Maryland case are seeking to halt the president\u2019s entire executive order and warn the United States is already nearing Trump\u2019s new refu\u00adgee limit. As of last week, more than 37,000 refugees had been admitted to the United States, according to the State Department. Lawyers say Trump\u2019s order leaves 60,000 other refugees \u2014 and the organizations that help them \u2014 in the lurch this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. \u201cThat makes their ability to carry out their mission nearly impossible,\u201d said Melissa Keaney, a lawyer with the National Immigration Law Center, which is arguing the Maryland case with the ACLU and others. \u201cThey have to basically scramble to try to find safe housing for individuals who are in very dangerous and precarious situations.\u201d In February, Robart suspended Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 entry ban, a broad executive order that suspended the refu\u00adgee program, halted travel for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, including those who already had been issued visas, and triggered chaos and protests at airports worldwide. When Robart froze Trump\u2019s original executive order, the president criticized him on Twitter, declaring him a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and deeming his ruling \u201cridiculous.\u201d But a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit unanimously upheld the judge\u2019s decision and kept Trump\u2019s entry ban on hold. Instead of appealing, Trump issued a revised order on March 6. The Justice Department has said the new measure supersedes the restraining order imposed on the initial ban, and will be enforced starting Thursday. [What Trump changed in the new travel ban] Trump\u2019s new order reduces the list of affected countries from seven to six \u2014 removing Iraq, while keeping Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and Syria. The order blocks the issuance of new visas for 90 days \u2014 exempting those with green cards or visas in hand \u2014 and spells out a robust list of people who could apply for exemptions. The order maintains a 120-day freeze on the refugee program and slashes the number to be admitted this year. On Monday, the state of Washington asked the court to stop the administration from carrying out the latest executive order. \u201cInjunctions are not suggestions,\u201d lawyers for the state of Washington wrote. \u201cWhen a court enjoins a defendant from enforcing policies, the defendant cannot evade the injunction by announcing that it will continue only some of the illegal policies.\u201d The new order undoubtedly reduces the number of people with standing to sue. But civil liberties advocates and others say it is still legally problematic. Washington and other states have said the order imposes economic harm on them, and that, like the first ban, it is unconstitutional because it is intended to discriminate against Muslims. \u201cThe problem is that this administration from the beginning has said that its intent was to discriminate against Muslims and shut out Muslims,\u201d said Cecilia Wang, the ACLU\u2019s deputy legal director. Federal officials have disputed that characterization and said the order is necessary for national security. The administration also argues that there is no need to freeze the order while people challenge it in court because it does \u201cno imminent harm.\u201d \u201cNo visa is revoked. No lawful permanent resident traveling abroad is barred from returning,\u201d the Justice Department said in a brief filed Monday in the Maryland lawsuit. \u201cNobody lawfully in the United States loses any prior ability to leave the country to travel and later return. . . . Plaintiffs, in short, identify no cataclysm that will befall them on March 16 or any time soon thereafter.\u201d Sirine Shebaya, a civil rights lawyer and member of the Dulles Justice Coalition, a group of mostly lawyers who mobilized after Trump\u2019s initial ban in January, said the organization is preparing for another wave of chaos and confusion at airports around the world. The group has maintained a skeleton staff at Dulles International Airport since the first order, but Shebaya said it will return in larger numbers Thursday. Other groups are planning protests at the airport on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to ramp up our presence,\u201d she said.

It was scheduled just as Justice Department lawyers made their final written pitch to immediately restore the president\u2019s order \u2014 and as tech companies, law professors and former high-ranking national security officials joined a mushrooming legal campaign to keep the measure suspended. Justice Department lawyers asserted that the executive order was \u201ca lawful exercise of the President\u2019s authority over the entry of aliens into the United States and the admission of refugees,\u201d and that U.S. District Judge James Robart\u2019s order to stop it was \u201cvastly overbroad.\u201d The future of the temporary ban now lies with three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit: William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Judge Richard Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama.

It is unclear how soon a ruling could follow. The hearing will be live-streamed, the clerk of court said. With the court case ongoing, those once stopped from coming to the United States have rushed to come into the country. The Department of Homeland Security said it was suspending all enforcement of Trump\u2019s directive after the federal judge in Seattle ordered it frozen, and many travelers have since been able to reunite with family here. [Court document: Declaration of National Security Officials] The broad legal issue is whether Trump exceeded his authority and violated the First Amendment and federal immigration law, and whether his executive order imposes irreparable harm on those it affects. Either Justice Department lawyers representing the Trump administration, or the states of Washington and Minnesota \u2014 which had successfully sued to put the ban on hold \u2014 could ask the Supreme Court to intervene if they disagree with the appeals court decision. The Supreme Court, though, remains one justice short, and many see it as ideologically split 4-4. A tie would keep in place whatever the appeals court decides. The rhetoric from both sides has been fierce. The states of Washington and Minnesota argued in a filing Monday that reinstating the ban would \u201cunleash chaos again\u201d by \u201cseparating families, stranding our university students and faculty, and barring travel.\u201d Justice Department lawyers countered that noncitizens outside the United States have \u201cno substantive right or basis for judicial review in the denial of a visa at all,\u201d and that, at most, the lower court judge should have limited his ruling to \u201cpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\u201d Federal immigration law undeniably gives the president broad authority to bar people from coming into the United States, saying that if he finds \u201cthe entry of any aliens\u201d would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to the country\u2019s interests, he can impose restrictions. Legal analysts have said those challenging the ban will face an uphill climb to overturn it. [Court document: Amicus brief by tech companies] Yet the opposition has been successful so far, and it is growing. On Monday, 10 former high-ranking diplomatic and national security officials; nearly 100 Silicon Valley tech companies; more than 280 law professors; a coalition of 16 state or district attorneys general, including those from D.C., Maryland and Virginia; and a host of civil liberties and other organizations formally lent their support to the legal bid to block Trump\u2019s order. While it is not unusual for outside parties to weigh in on legal cases of such public interest, the breadth and depth of those lining up behind Washington and Minnesota is notable. Former secretaries of state John F. Kerry and Madeleine Albright, along with former CIA director Leon Panetta, former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael Hayden and other former top national security officials, attached their names to an affidavit declaring there was \u201cno national security purpose\u201d for a complete barring of people from the seven affected countries. \u201cSince September 11, 2001, not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order,\u201d the group declared. \u201cVery few attacks on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001 have been traced to foreign nationals at all.\u201d [Travelers from Iran board flights to the United States following stay, attorney says] Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Uber and other companies asserted in a brief that Trump\u2019s order \u201chinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations \u2014 and hire new employees \u2014 outside the United States.\u201d And 16 attorneys general said, while their specific businesses and residents were different, \u201call stand to face the concrete, immediate, and irreparable harms caused by the Executive Order.\u201d Trump and his supporters have continued to press the case that the short-term stoppage on refugees and immigrants from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen is necessary for national security reasons.

(Gabriella Demczuk/Getty Images) The state of Texas on Wednesday threw its weight behind the Trump administration in the legal battle over the president\u2019s executive order temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, arguing in a court filing that Trump was well within his authority to stop certain foreigners from entering the country while officials reassess vetting procedures. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in an amicus brief to reconsider a decision by one of its three-judge panels to keep the travel ban frozen. His is the first state to come out in support of the ban in the court case; 21 have lined up on the other side, including Washington and Minnesota, which successfully sued to stop it. \u201cLike every other State in the Union, amicus has a significant interest in protecting its residents\u2019 safety,\u201d Paxton wrote. \u201cBut the State itself possesses no authority to set the terms and conditions of entry for aliens seeking to enter the United States, or to restrict the entry of such aliens for foreign-affairs, public-safety, or national-security reasons. Instead, the State relies on the federal Executive Branch to carry out that function, pursuant to the laws of Congress.\u201d [4 ways the Trump administration could fight for its travel ban] For now, Trump\u2019s travel ban remains frozen, and the president has said he is considering rewriting the executive order. Judges nationwide have ruled against him \u2014 most recently, a federal judge in Virginia issued a scathing opinion that confronted directly whether his order was legal \u2014 although the court battle is ongoing. The next big question is whether the 9th Circuit will consider the matter en banc and \u2014 if so \u2014 possibly end its own three-judge panel\u2019s freeze on the ban. Texas argued in its brief that the 9th Circuit should intervene and end \u201ca remarkable use of the judicial power to interfere with the President\u2019s national-security decisions in an area of strongest executive authority.\u201d The state argued that Trump\u2019s ban was not discriminatory, but, rather, grounded in real national security concerns. The case already had attracted significant attention from outside interests. Attorneys general for California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and the District of Columbia urged the court to keep the ban frozen in another amicus brief, and the state of Hawaii, which has sued on its own, also asked to intervene. Ten former high-ranking diplomatic and national security officials argued that there was \u201cno national security purpose\u201d for a complete barring of people from the seven affected countries, nearly 100 Silicon Valley tech companies argued that the ban could hurt their businesses. Texas is no stranger to using the federal court system in immigration matters, although the last time around, it joined 25 other Republican-led states in suing to stop executive action by President Barack Obama. They were ultimately successful in that challenge, after a lower court decided that Obama probably had exceeded his powers and a deadlocked Supreme Court left that ruling undisturbed. Paxton at the time hailed the decision as keeping the president in check. \u201cToday\u2019s decision keeps in place what we have maintained from the very start: One person, even a president, cannot unilaterally change the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a major setback to President Obama\u2019s attempts to expand executive power and a victory for those who believe in the separation of powers and the rule of law.\u201d Read more: Why Virginia matters in the travel ban fight 7 key takeaways from the court\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s immigration order", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-02-15", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Federal judge temporarily blocks Trump\u2019s entry order nationwide", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trumps-immigration-order-nationwide/2017/02/03/9b734e1c-ea54-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html", "text": "A federal judge in Washington state on Friday temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump\u2019s controversial ban on entry to the United States, and airlines planned to begin allowing passengers from banned countries to board, according to a person familiar with the matter.

(Reuters) He also claimed that \u201ccertain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban.\u201d \u201cThey know if certain people are allowed in it\u2019s death & destruction!\u201d he posted. The federal judge\u2019s ruling, which was broader than similar ones before it, set up a high-stakes legal confrontation between the new president and the judicial branch over his temporary ban on entry by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries as well as refugees. In his opinion, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart wrote that \u201cfundamental\u201d to the court\u2019s work was \u201ca vigilant recognition that it is but one of three equal branches of our federal government.\u201d \u201cThe court concludes that the circumstances brought before it today are such that it must intervene to fulfill its constitutional role in our tripart government,\u201d he wrote. The ruling is temporary, and the ultimate question of whether Trump\u2019s executive order will pass constitutional muster will fall to higher-level courts. Legal analysts have said the ban could be difficult to permanently undo because the president has broad authority to set immigration policy. Robart granted a request from lawyers for the state of Washington who had asked him to stop the government from acting on critical sections of Trump\u2019s order. Justice and State department officials had revealed earlier Friday that about 60,000 \u2014 and possibly as many as 100,000 \u2014 visas already have been provisionally revoked as a result of Trump\u2019s order. A U.S. official said that because of the court case, officials would examine the revoking of those visas so that people would be allowed to travel. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson hailed the case as \u201cthe first of its kind\u201d and declared that it \u201cshuts down the executive order immediately.\u201d Robart, a judge appointed by George W. Bush, said in his written order that U.S. officials should stop enforcing the key aspects of the ban: the halting of entry by refugees and citizens from certain countries. He did not specifically address the matter of those whose visas already had been revoked. The Justice Department said in a statement that it was \u201creviewing the court\u2019s order and will determine next steps.\u201d A State Department official said the agency was \u201cworking closely with the Department of Homeland Security and our legal teams to determine how this affects our operations.\u201d \u201cWe will announce any changes affecting travelers to the United States as soon as that information is available,\u201d the official said. Immigration lawyers said Friday night that they were still assessing the Washington case but were heartened by it. \u201cThe order makes it clear that all of the main provisions of the executive order cannot be enforced at this time,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \u201cThat means that a lot will have to change immediately, and the government will have to make clear how they intend to follow the order with respect to all of the ways in which immigrants here and abroad are being affected at the moment.\u201d Since it was first rolled out a week ago, Trump\u2019s travel ban has been evolving \u2014 both because of legal challenges and as a result of decisions by the administration to walk back aspects of it. Green-card holders from the affected countries, for example, no longer need waivers to get into the United States, as they did when the order took effect. And the Department of Homeland Security asserted Friday that the order does not apply to dual citizens with passports from countries other than the seven listed. [Has your visa been affected by Trump\u2019s travel ban? Tell us about it.] The numbers of visas revoked, too, demonstrated the far-reaching impact of the order. Families have been split, students unable to pursue their education, and those in the United States unable to leave for fear of not being able to return \u2014 and not by the handful, but by the tens of thousands. During a hearing in a lawsuit by two Yemeni brothers who arrived at Dulles International Airport last Saturday and were quickly put on a return flight to Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia because of the new restrictions, a Justice Department lawyer said 100,000 visas had been revoked. The figure, though, was immediately disputed by the State Department, which said the number of visas revoked was roughly 60,000. A spokeswoman said earlier Friday the revocations have no impact on the legal status of people already in the United States, but if those people left the country, their visas would no longer be valid. About the same time, in Boston, a group of four students enrolled in area colleges, a researcher and the spouse of a permanent resident \u2014 all of whom came from countries affected by the ban \u2014 flew into the United States. The group that entered was aboard the same flight from Frankfurt operated by the German airline Lufthansa, which a day earlier had noted on its website a court decision from last weekend that it claimed had \u201csuspended\u201d Trump\u2019s decree on flights to Boston. Lawyers hailed the development as good news. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six more today than we had yesterday,\u201d said Susan Church, an attorney for the American Immigration Lawyers Association of New England. [No matter what you call it, Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration will be tough to overturn] Among those who made their way back to the United States were two undergraduate Massachusetts Institute of Technology students who had been visiting their families for winter break; as well as 27-year-old Behnam Partopour, a PhD student from Iran studying chemical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who had been working on a project in Germany; and Samira Asgari, an Iranian scientist who was headed to Boston to conduct research at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. Colleen Wamback of Worcester Polytechnic Institute said Partopour had a student visa which was issued before the executive order but was delayed in getting to him. Asgari, on the other hand, had tried twice to board flights to the United States but was turned away because of the ban. She had filed a lawsuit over the matter. Washington and Minnesota had filed a broad legal challenge to Trump\u2019s order, alleging it was \u201cseparating families, harming thousands of the States\u2019 residents, damaging the States\u2019 economies, hurting State-based companies, and undermining both States\u2019 sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees.\u201d Jeffrey P. Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post and a Washington state resident, has spoken out against the ban. In the past several days, federal judges in New York, California, Massachusetts and Virginia have issued rulings temporarily blocking aspects of the Trump order \u2014 though the orders all seemed to be limited to people who had made their way to U.S. airports, or, in Virginia\u2019s case, to certain people. The New York and Massachusetts rulings both blocked the government from detaining or deporting anyone from the seven affected countries who could legally enter the U.S., and the Massachusetts ruling added the critical phrase \u201cabsent the executive order.\u201d In California, a judge declared that U.S. officials were also prevented from \u201cblocking\u201d people from entering who had a valid visa.

The Justice Department on Monday filed its first significant legal defense of Trump\u2019s revised travel ban. (Olivier Douliery/Bloomberg News) The Justice Department on Monday laid out its first significant legal defense of President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban, arguing in a court filing that the harms opponents say it causes are \u201cspeculative\u201d and that the president was well within his authority to issue the directive. Responding to a lawsuit from the state of Hawaii, Justice Department lawyers asserted that Trump\u2019s new executive order solved any possible legal problems that came with the first one, because it was narrower in scope and outlined a robust list of people who might be exempted. \u201cPlaintiffs therefore are not entitled to the sweeping relief they seek,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote. [Why Hawaii says Trump\u2019s new travel ban is still unconstitutional] Opponents of Trump\u2019s executive order have asked federal judges in several states to block the administration from enforcing the directive, and two judges have scheduled hearings Wednesday to hear arguments on the matter. The order \u2014 which suspends the U.S.\u2019s refu\u00adgee program and bars the issuance of new visas to citizens of six Muslim-majority countries \u2014 is set to take effect Thursday, unless a court intervenes. Hawaii was the first state to sue over the directive, arguing the new executive order \u2014 much like the old \u2014 violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment because it is essentially a Muslim ban, hurts the ability of state businesses and universities to recruit top talent and damages the state\u2019s robust tourism industry. They pointed particularly to the case of Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii, whose mother-in-law\u2019s application for an immigrant visa was still being processed. Under the new executive order, lawyers for Hawaii said, Elshikh feared that his mother-in-law would ultimately be banned from entering the United States. Justice Department lawyers countered that the economic harms alleged by the state were \u201cmere speculation\u201d and that Elshikh\u2019s mother-in-law had no reason to sue yet because she had not been denied a waiver to come into the country. The new executive order, unlike the old, spelled out a list of people who might be granted exemptions, including those seeking to visit or live with family in the United States. \u201cThe Order applies only to individuals outside the country who do not have a current visa, and even as to them, it sets forth robust waiver provisions,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote. \u201cAmong other things, therefore, plaintiffs cannot show that any individual whom they seek to protect is in imminent risk of being denied entry due to the Order.\u201d The state will have to convince a judge that Trump\u2019s ban is likely to be ultimately found unconstitutional and will impose immediate, irreparable harms unless it is stopped. A hearing in the case is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday. Federal judges in Washington state and Maryland are also considering separate challenges to the new ban, and either could preempt the need for action in Hawaii. A hearing in the Maryland case is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, and Washington on Monday formally asked a judge to enforce his freeze of the previous ban on the new one. The judge told the government to respond by Tuesday. [Judge in Maryland will weigh Trump travel ban the day before it takes effect] \u201cWhile the new section differs from the original by excluding Iraqis, lawful permanent residents, and visa-holders, it bars entry for virtually all other individuals from the listed countries, including: relatives of U.S. citizens, students who have been admitted to state universities, prospective employees of state universities and private businesses, and many others,\u201d lawyers for the state of Washington wrote. \u201cThis Court\u2019s original injunction protected these individuals and institutions, and the Ninth Circuit rejected Defendants\u2019 request to narrow the injunction to exclude them.\u201d The administration has argued the ban is necessary for national security reasons, though many diplomatic and national security professionals have said they disagree with that assessment, and the new ban would probably not have kept out anyone responsible for a fatal terrorist attack since 2001. In their filing, Justice Department lawyers pointed to 300 people who entered the United States as refugees and are under investigation for terrorism-related crimes and asserted that hundreds of foreign-born individuals have been convicted of such offenses. They attached a letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly asking President Trump to direct a \u201ctemporary pause\u201d on people entering the U.S. from certain countries. \u201cMore fundamentally, plaintiffs miss the point,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote. \u201cThe Order\u2019s objective is to prevent future terrorist attacks before they occur. And that is precisely why the Order focuses on six countries that Congress and the prior Administration recently determined pose the greatest risk of terrorist infiltration in the future.\u201d A federal judge in Wisconsin recently blocked the administration from enforcing with respect to one family. In that case, a man who had successfully fled Syria and been granted asylum in the United States sued so that the ban would not be applied to his wife and 3-year-old daughter, who are still in Aleppo and have asylum applications being processed. The judge ruled that the family had \u201csome likelihood of success on the merits\u201d and that the man was \u201cat great risk of suffering irreparable harm\u201d if the order was not blocked, so far as it applied to his family. \u201cThe court appreciates that there may be important differences between the original executive order, and the revised executive order issued on March 6, 2017 \u2014 for example, the government points to a new waiver provision,\u201d Judge William M. Conley wrote. \u201cAs the order applies to the plaintiff here, however, the court finds his claims have at least some chance of prevailing for the reasons articulated by other courts.\u201d", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-03-13", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Grandparents, refugees with formal assurances can enter under Trump\u2019s travel ban, appeals court rules", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/grandparents-refugees-with-formal-assurances-can-enter-under-trumps-travel-ban-appeals-court-rules/2017/09/07/d0763ca8-9415-11e7-8754-d478688d23b4_story.html", "text": "Grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States are exempt from President Trump\u2019s travel ban, as are refugees with a formal assurance from a government agency, a federal appeals court panel ruled Thursday. The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is a blow to the government, which after the most recent Supreme Court compromise had been allowed to block refugees with assurances, though not grandparents and other extended relatives. \u201cResettlement agencies will face concrete harms and burdens if refugees with formal assurances are not admitted,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cIn the same way that the Court considered the harms of the U.S. citizen who wants to be reunited with his mother-in-law and the permanent resident who wants to be reunited with his wife, the employer that hired an employee, the university that admitted a student, and the American audience that invited a lecturer, the district court correctly considered the resettlement agency that has given a formal assurance for specific refugees.\u201d The judges also said their ruling would take effect in just five days \u2014 on Tuesday \u2014 a significant decrease from the normal 52 days, saying that refugees\u2019 lives \u201cremain in vulnerable limbo\u201d in their current uncertain state. The government has estimated there are about 24,000 refugees with formal assurances. A Justice Department spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cThe Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the Executive Branch\u2019s duty to protect the Nation.\u201d The ruling does not get to the heart of whether the travel ban is lawful. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on that next month. And given that the measure was supposed to have been temporary \u2014 90 days for citizens of the six countries affected by the ban and 120 days for refugees \u2014 it is also possible that the dispute will be moot by then. In the 9th Circuit, the parties had essentially been arguing over who could be excluded from entering the United States after the justices in June ruled that a limited version of the travel ban could take effect. The high court had said officials could not enforce the measure on those with \u201ca credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with a person or entity in the United States, but offered only limited guidance on what type of relationship would qualify. \u201cClose familial\u201d relationships would count, the court said, as would ties such as a job offer or school acceptance letter that were \u201cformal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course.\u201d The same standard applied to citizens of the six countries affected by the ban \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 as well as all refugees. [Supreme Court allows limited version of Trump\u2019s travel ban to take effect and will consider case in fall] The government initially sought to block grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the country from entering, along with refugees with formal assurance letters from resettlement agencies, but a U.S. district judge ultimately prevented the government from doing so. The Supreme Court then put on hold the portion of that district judge\u2019s ruling on refugees, but not on grandparents and other extended relatives of people in the United States. That led to the legal wrangling before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit judges wrote that the government had not offered persuasive evidence that grandparents and other extended relatives did not count as \u201cclose\u201d family members, rejecting the government\u2019s argument that they had drawn their position from immigration law. They rejected similar arguments on refugees with assurances. The 9th Circuit opinion was written by Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard A.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) President Trump is expected to pay his first visit to the Supreme Court on Thursday. His words and actions precede him. Trump\u2019s planned drop-by for the official investiture of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch comes as the president\u2019s lawyers make almost daily filings with the justices in an attempt to revive his ban on refugees and travelers from six mostly Muslim countries. [Trump turns to Supreme Court on travel ban] The court could decide by next week whether to allow Trump\u2019s executive order to go into effect or follow the lead of lower courts that have stopped the order because they say it exceeds the president\u2019s authority and discriminates unconstitutionally. It\u2019s unlikely the high-stakes legal maneuvering will be mentioned Thursday, nor Trump\u2019s blasts at the federal judiciary in general and some of the justices specifically. Trump has called Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u201can absolute disaster\u201d for conservatives. After Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in interviews last summer called Trump a \u201cfaker\u201d and said she feared for the country if he were elected, Trump responded by saying that \u201cher mind is shot\u201d and that she should retire. Since then, Roberts administered the oath of office to Trump on Inauguration Day, and all of the justices attended a Rose Garden ceremony after the Senate confirmed Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. Differences traditionally are put aside for a new justice\u2019s investiture, a short but formal and history-laden event that culminates in iconic photos of the chief justice and the new justice descending the Supreme Court\u2019s famous marble steps. Gorsuch actually joined the court April 10 and earlier this week delivered his first opinion. [Kagan officially sworn in, says she is \u201cset\u201d for new term] At the last investiture ceremony in 2010, for his nominee Elena Kagan, President Barack Obama mingled beforehand with the justices he had criticized in his previous State of the Union address for their decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. \u201cYou\u2019re always welcome here,\u201d the chief justice told the president during the ceremony. But it is rare for the court and the president to get together when such an important executive branch priority is pending. Trump signed his first executive order imposing a travel ban just after he was inaugurated in January. It was struck down by a judge in Washington state, and that decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Even though Trump vowed to take his initial ban to the Supreme Court then, his administration instead issued in March what Trump later tweeted was a \u201cwatered-down\u201d version. The revised ban suspends travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days to give the administration time to conduct a review of whether proper vetting procedures are in place to ensure travelers are not a threat to national security. The order also suspends the nation\u2019s refu\u00adgee program for 120 days and imposes a new limit on the number of refugees accepted. A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit just this week upheld the decision of a federal judge in Hawaii to keep that executive order from going into effect. The judges said that Congress had given the president great power in immigration decisions but that Trump had not shown national security warranted the actions he had taken. [Appeals court keeps freeze on travel ban in place] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, meanwhile, said banning travelers from the six countries was really just a way for Trump to make good on his campaign promise of a ban on Muslims. That was an unconstitutional form of discrimination, the court said in a 10-to-3 ruling. The Supreme Court is now being asked to lift the stays and accept the case for oral argument. The court granted the administration\u2019s request that briefing on the issue be extended to June 21. But the court is scheduled to end its term June 26, so that would seem to mean even if the court accepted the case, it would not be scheduled for argument until the fall. Steve Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor who has closely followed the litigation, said the proposal is \u201cnot the kind of move you\u2019d expect from a government in a hurry.\u201d The pause on immigration was supposed to be only so the administration could ensure proper vetting procedures were in place. The 9th Circuit opinion said the administration was free to undertake that study but without the travel ban. That lessens the government\u2019s need to lift the stays, Vladeck said, unless the real objective of the executive order is to block travelers, rather than to ensure the proper vetting procedures are in place.

(Steve Helber/AP) A federal appeals court that President Trump has frequently criticized is to hear arguments Monday on whether to restore his controversial travel ban \u2014 a significant step in the legal battle that has prevented Trump from implementing one of his signature initiatives on immigration. A three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit will join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in deciding whether Trump ran afoul of the Constitution when he tried to temporarily shut down the U.S. refu\u00adgee program and suspend the issuance of new visas to residents of six Muslim-majority countries. The 9th Circuit blocked Trump\u2019s first travel ban, and now a different set of judges on the panel will weigh a revised version. The 4th Circuit, which is based in Richmond, heard arguments on the matter last week. [All the times Trump personally attacked judges \u2014 and why his tirades are \u2018worse than wrong\u2019] The views of each side are familiar by now. Those challenging the ban say it is unconstitutional and motivated by Trump\u2019s desire to discriminate against Muslims, and they point to Trump\u2019s comments and those of his advisers as evidence to prove their case. The Justice Department argues that the executive order is well within the president\u2019s power, and that lower courts have been wrong to second-guess him on a matter of national security. Last week, a federal judge in Michigan ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other advisers \u2014 whose comments judges nationwide have pointed to as they have ordered to freeze the ban. That case is separate from the two that have put Trump\u2019s latest ban on hold. U.S. district judges in Hawaii and Maryland have ordered key sections of the president\u2019s order frozen, and to fully reinstate the measure, the Justice Department would have to win in both the 4th and 9th circuits \u2014 or escalate the dispute to the Supreme Court. The three judges considering the matter in the 9th Circuit \u2014 Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald M. Gould and Richard A. Paez \u2014 were appointed by President Bill Clinton. The 4th Circuit heard the case with all its judges, a step the 9th Circuit declined to take. [President Trump\u2019s lawyers on revised travel ban repeatedly asked about campaign promises] Trump has not been shy about criticizing judges who rule against him, but he seems to have particular ire for the 9th Circuit. When U.S. District Judge William Orrick blocked his executive order on stripping federal funding from sanctuary cities, Trump incorrectly attributed the decision to the 9th Circuit as he wrote on Twitter, \u201cFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities \u2014 both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!\u201d Orrick is a \u00adlower-court judge whose rulings would be reviewed by the 9th Circuit. Trump then wrote that the circuit had a \u201cterrible record of being overturned\u201d \u2014 a claim that is highly debatable \u2014 and he said later that he had \u201cabsolutely\u201d considered breaking up the court.

In a speech to law enforcement officials in Washington, Trump argued his executive action is clearly legal and read aloud the relevant part of the law, which he called \u201cso simple and so beautifully written and so perfectly written.\u201d \u201cI watched last night, in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn\u2019t believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t ever want to call a court biased, so I won\u2019t call it biased. And we haven\u2019t had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what\u2019s right.\u201d Trump insisted the order was within his executive powers and \u201ca bad high school student would understand this.\u201d The court said it would not issue a decision Wednesday but previously indicated a ruling could come this week. The panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit on Tuesday aggressively questioned a Justice Department lawyer about what he considered the limits on the president\u2019s power and what evidence Trump relied upon in temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. (Dalton Bennett,Ahmed Deeb/The Washington Post) But the panel similarly interrogated Washington state\u2019s solicitor general, who is challenging the president\u2019s directive, over what evidence he had to demonstrate religious discrimination and whether a lower-court judge\u2019s freeze on the ban was too broad. The court said it expects to make a decision on the matter \u201cprobably this week,\u201d and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland promised rapid consideration. The ruling could affect tens of thousands of travelers whose visas were revoked by the initial executive order, then restored after U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle put a nationwide stop to it. The issue of whether the order is allowed to remain in place while legal challenges continue is likely to end up at the Supreme Court. But it will be harder for the Trump administration to prevail at the high court if the appeals court rules that a nationwide halt is warranted. The broad legal question is whether Trump acted within his authority in blocking the entry of people from Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Syria and Yemen, or whether his order essentially amounts to a discriminatory ban on Muslims. The judges must also weigh the harm the ban imposes and whether it is proper for them to intervene in a national security matter on which the president is viewed as the ultimate authority. Earlier Wednesday, Trump added to his barrage of comments decrying the challenge to the order, and casting blame if the decision does not go his way. \u201cIf the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cPolitics!\u201d Later, before his address to the police chiefs and sheriffs, Trump appeared to describe the legal challenges as \u201chorrible, dangerous and wrong.\u201d Justice Department lawyer August E. Flentje argued Tuesday that the order was \u201cwell within the president\u2019s power,\u201d asserting that Congress and a previous administration had designated the seven affected countries as having problems with terrorism \u2014 albeit in a different context. Some of the judges, though, seemed wary of that claim. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked Flentje if the government had \u201cpointed to any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism.\u201d Judge Richard Clifton, a President George W. Bush appointee, noted that the government already had processes in place to screen people coming from those countries and asked, \u201cIs there any reason for us to think that there\u2019s a real risk or that circumstances have changed such that there\u2019s a real risk?\u201d \u201cThe president determined that there was a real risk,\u201d Flentje responded. Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued that the government was essentially asking the court to \u201cabdicate\u201d its role as a check on the executive branch, and he asserted that reinstating the ban would \u201cthrow the country back into chaos.\u201d But Purcell, too, faced critical questions. Clifton said that he was having \u201ctrouble understanding why we\u2019re supposed to infer religious animus when in fact the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected\u201d \u2014 a key point, as the state is trying to demonstrate that Trump\u2019s order is intentionally discriminatory and runs afoul of the Constitution. Purcell pointed to public statements from Trump and his allies. Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for example, recently said: \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said: \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d Flentje disputed that the order is a Muslim ban, and he said the judges should limit their consideration to the executive order itself. \u201cIt is extraordinary to enjoin the president\u2019s national security determination based on some newspaper articles, and that\u2019s what has happened here,\u201d he said. [Federal appeals court decides to schedule a hearing on Trump travel order] Whichever side loses is sure to take the fight to the Supreme Court. That traditionally has been solid ground for presidents. Justices often defer to a president on matters of immigration and national security, because of his constitutional powers and an additional grant of authority from Congress. The politically divisive fight comes as the Supreme Court remains shorthanded following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia nearly a year ago; the four Democratic-appointed liberals and four Republican-appointed conservatives often split. Trump said at a White House event Tuesday that he was prepared to elevate the dispute as needed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it through the system,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the country \u2026 We\u2019ll see what happens. We have a big court case. We\u2019re well represented.\u201d Flentje did offer something of a compromise for the judges Tuesday, saying they could limit the lower-court judge\u2019s ruling to foreigners previously admitted to the country who were abroad now or those who wished to travel and return to the United States in the future. Purcell countered that officials had not explained how they would practically implement such an order. In addition to Clifton and Friedland, the case was heard by William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter. The hearing was conducted via telephone, with Friedland listening from San Jose, Canby from Phoenix and Clifton from Hono\u00adlulu. If those judges turn down the administration\u2019s appeal and the matter moves immediately to the Supreme Court, the argument would be only on the temporary restraining order, and it would require five justices to reverse the lower court\u2019s actions. The high court faced a similar issue last term, when a Texas judge imposed a nationwide halt on an executive action from Obama that would have shielded more than 4 million immigrants who were in the country illegally, but who met certain requirements to get work permits. The justices then split 4 to 4 on the matter. If five justices could not agree, the case would return to Robart, the district judge, to decide whether Trump\u2019s order should be permanently enjoined. The fight up the legal ladder would then begin anew \u2014 possibly taking months, past when the travel ban is set to expire. Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly predicted Tuesday that the administration would prevail in its bid to reinstate the executive order and said judges might be considering the matter from an \u201cacademic,\u201d rather than a national security, perspective. \u201cOf course, in their courtrooms, they\u2019re protected by people like me,\u201d he said. Testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee, Kelly forcefully defended the measure as a necessary \u201cpause\u201d so officials could improve vetting procedures. He said that it is \u201centirely possible\u201d that dangerous people are now entering the country with the order on hold \u2014 as Trump has said via Twitter \u2014 and that officials might not know about them until it is too late. \u201cNot until the boom,\u201d he said when asked if he could provide evidence of a dangerous person coming into the country since the ban was suspended. [Trump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn\u2019t have prevented] Kelly\u2019s view does not reflect the consensus of the national security community. Ten high-ranking diplomatic and security officials \u2014 among them former secretaries of state John F. Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former CIA director Leon E. Panetta, and former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael V. Hayden \u2014 said in a legal filing that there was \u201cno national security purpose\u201d for a complete barring of people from the seven affected countries. Kelly also acknowledged Tuesday that if he were given a second chance, he might do things differently in rolling out the order. That stands somewhat in contrast to Trump\u2019s recent assertion to Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly that the implementation was \u201cvery smooth,\u201d and it is important because \u2014 if the appeals court reinstates the ban \u2014 Kelly might get another crack at implementation. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have \u2014 this is all on me, by the way \u2014 I should have delayed it just a bit, so that I could talk to members of Congress, particularly the leadership of committees like this, to prepare them for what was coming, although I think most people would agree that this has been a topic of President Trump certainly during his campaign and during the transition process,\u201d Kelly said. He later said, though, that most of the confusion that followed the signing of the order was attributable to court orders and occurred not among Customs and Border Protection officers but among protesters in airports. After people were initially detained and deported, demonstrators packed airports to voice their displeasure, and civil liberties and immigration lawyers filed lawsuits across the country. Many of those suits are ongoing, with lawyers keeping a close eye on the proceedings at the 9th Circuit. On Tuesday, a group of lawyers asked a federal judge in New York to force the government to turn over a list of those who had been detained or deported, as the court had previously ordered officials to do. The government has said no one is being detained and has debated what information it is required to provide. \u201cNoncompliance of a court order is very serious, especially where people\u2019s lives are at stake,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \u201cWe filed this motion to enforce because the government left us no choice.\u201d John Wagner contributed to this report.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-02-07", "authors": ["robert.barnes.3139"], "type": "article", "author_string": "robert barnes"}, {"title": "Judge orders government to turn over documents from Rudy Giuliani on travel ban", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/05/13/judge-orders-government-to-turn-over-documents-from-rudy-giuliani-on-travel-ban/", "text": " Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani arrives at Trump Tower in 2016. A federal judge in Michigan this week ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from the former New York mayor on the president\u2019s controversial travel ban. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) A federal judge in Michigan this week ordered the Trump administration to turn over communications from Rudolph W. Giuliani and other advisers on the president\u2019s controversial travel ban. Those suing over the matter hope the documents will bolster their bid to prove the ban was motivated by animus toward Muslims. Giuliani has been a key figure in the ban even before the first version was signed, and judges across the country have pointed to statements by the former New York mayor and close Trump ally as they have ordered the ban frozen. The judges have noted particularly a comment Giuliani made on Fox News in January, in which he seemed to suggest he helped the president craft a legal way to prevent Muslims from entering the U.S. \u201cSo when first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally,\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said at the time. [7 things Trump and his advisers have said about the travel ban that wound up hurting them in court] U.S. District Judge Victoria A. Roberts ordered the government to turn over to those suing a memo that Giuliani crafted, along with all \u201cdocuments or communications\u201d about the travel ban from him and several other Trump advisers, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior adviser Stephen Miller during the period just before the election, before they were in their current roles. Judges have noted Miller\u2019s comments, too, in putting the latest version of the ban on hold. \u201cWe believe these documents will show exactly how the Muslim ban that Donald Trump called for on the campaign trail turned into the executive order he issued a week after taking office,\u201d said Miriam Aukerman, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Michigan, in a written statement. \u201cIf the administration now still refuses to turn over these papers, the question will be: What is it trying to hide?\u201d The case in Michigan is not one of the two that have put Trump\u2019s latest travel ban on hold. It is proceeding at a slower pace and it could be significantly impacted by rulings elsewhere. On Monday, a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit Court is scheduled to hear arguments in one of those cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit heard arguments this week. In an interview, Giuliani said he was willing to turn over whatever documents he still had \u2014 but he noted the court\u2019s order was directed to the government, not to him personally. \u201cBasically, the advice was you can\u2019t ban, based on any religion,\u201d Giuliani said. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Giuliani also said his comment on Fox News had been misinterpreted, and that Trump had not asked him how to craft a legal Muslim ban. \u201cThat\u2019s the incorrect interpretation,\u201d Giuliani said. He said Trump more accurately asked, \u201cwhat can he do legally to keep the country safe\u201d or \u201cHow can I do whatever I\u2019m going to do legally?\u201d \u201cFor example, what we told him is he shouldn\u2019t do a Muslim ban,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe way I interpreted it, it was, \u2018Tell me what I can do legally,\u2019 not, \u2018Tell me how I can get around and do a Muslim ban and find some kind of legal justification for it.\u2019 We did just the opposite.\u201d Roberts ordered the government to turn over Giuliani\u2019s memo by May 19 and the rest of the materials by June 2.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-05-13", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "A new travel ban with \u2018mostly minor technical differences\u2019?

And legal analysts say it might not go far enough to allay the judiciary\u2019s concerns. A senior White House official said Wednesday that Trump will issue a revised executive order on immigration next week, as the administration is working to make sure the implementation goes smoothly. Trump had said previously that the order would come this week. Neither the president nor his top advisers have detailed exactly what the new order will entail. Miller\u2019s comments on Fox News, while vague, seem to suggest the changes might not be substantive. And that could hurt the administration\u2019s bid to lift the court-imposed suspension on the ban, analysts said. [Trump considers writing \u2018brand new\u2019 immigration order] \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to moot out litigation, which is to say, \u2018Look, this litigation is no longer necessary,\u2019 it is very bad to say our intent here is to engage in the prohibited outcome,\u201d said Leon Fresco, who worked in the office of immigration litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department. Trump\u2019s original travel ban temporarily barred from entering the United States refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Libya. When it was first implemented, State Department officials unilaterally revoked tens of thousands of visas, and the order seemed to affect even legal permanent residents, though the White House counsel soon clarified that it should not. A federal district judge in Washington state suspended the ban Feb. 3, and a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit later upheld that freeze. While the Justice Department could have appealed to the full appeals court \u2014 or even to the Supreme Court \u2014 it asked the 9th Circuit judges last week to hold off because a new executive order was in the works. \u201cRather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the Order and replace it with a new, substantially revised Executive Order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns,\u201d Justice Department lawyers wrote. [4 ways the Trump administration could fight for its travel ban] Officials still plan a new order, but White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that they would not rescind the old one. And speaking to Fox News\u2019s Martha MacCallum, Miller seemed to play down how substantial even the revisions would be \u2014 which would seem to put him at odds with the Justice Department. \u201cWell, one of the big differences that you\u2019re going to see in the executive order is that it\u2019s going to be responsive to the judicial ruling, which didn\u2019t exist previously. And so these are mostly minor technical differences,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamentally, you\u2019re still going to have the same basic policy outcome for the country, but you\u2019re going to be responsive to a lot of very technical issues that were brought up by the court and those will be addressed. But in terms of protecting the country, those basic policies are still going to be in effect.\u201d Legal analysts have said previously that there are obvious ways in which the order could be cleaned up to help it pass legal muster \u2014 though anything that maintains outright bans might face a tough court battle. Trump could craft an order that clearly exempts green-card holders \u2014 who have the best case to sue over the order \u2014 and he could also potentially exempt any current visa holders. But the 9th Circuit panel said that would not address claims \u201cby citizens who have an interest in specific noncitizens\u2019 ability to travel to the United States.\u201d And no matter what it does, the Trump administration must contend with the president\u2019s own call on the campaign trail for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d and campaign surrogate Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s claim that Trump said \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and asked him to form a commission to determine \u201cthe right way to do it legally.\u201d A federal judge in Virginia referenced those comments in ordering the ban frozen with respect to Virginia residents and institutions, calling it \u201cunrebutted evidence\u201d that Trump\u2019s directive might violate the First Amendment. That is important because if judges found even the new order was designed to discriminate against Muslims \u2014 and not to protect national security \u2014 they might similarly strike it down.The president does possess broad power to set immigration policy, and even his original executive order might ultimately pass legal muster, analysts have said. So far, courts have just weighed temporary injunctions on the ban, not directly and finally deciding whether Trump exceeded his authority. \u201cTo the extent that the new executive order just makes technical changes, then we don\u2019t see it solving any of the legal problems,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who is involved in a legal challenge to the ban in New York. At the White House press briefing Wednesday, Spicer said he was confident the administration would ultimately prevail in court, but in the revised order officials had been \u201cvery clear about understanding what the court said, and trying to tailor that specifically.\u201d He also said he was not concerned that Trump\u2019s prior remarks about targeting Muslims would hinder the administration\u2019s case. \u201cThe president was very clear in his executive order that these were countries that we didn\u2019t have the proper vetting for when it came to ensuring the safety of Americans,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the executive order said. \u2026 It was crafted in a way that was very clear about the countries and was not focused on anything else but the vetting requirements.\u201d Revisions, analysts said, could ultimately help Trump prevail \u2014 particularly if he applied a ban only to the issuance of new visas, and if he issued robust procedures for those whose visas were revoked to challenge that action. His and Giuliani\u2019s comments would be an obstacle, but they would not necessarily block him forever from using his powers on immigration. \u201cAre you permanently prohibited from ever doing something like this because you at one time said something that was inappropriate?\u201d Fresco said. \u201cThe courts will have to decide what they believe here.\u201d Philip Rucker and John Wagner contributed to this report.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-02-22", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "The government now says 746 people were held due to the travel ban.

On Thursday, the Justice Department added another wrinkle, turning over to the ACLU a list of 746 names of those who were held, in any capacity, because of the executive order during a 26\u00bd hour stretch from Jan. 28 to Jan. 29 \u2014 before the president\u2019s tweet.

That probably won\u2019t cut it, analysts say.] A Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately return a message seeking comment. A Department of Homeland Security official said the difference in counts is likely attributable to officials taking different snapshots in time. As flights landed initially, the official said, 109 people were detained. But as more came in, the number swelled. It was not immediately clear why the president would then use an out-of-date figure.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 Exactly what happened to each of the 746 people also is unclear. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said that at a court hearing Friday, government lawyers indicated the majority were lawful permanent residents. Some might have been processed into the United States with relatively minor hassle, while others could have faced prolonged detainment or even more significant hardships. Gelernt said the government initially turned over just a list of names, but they agreed on Friday to identify those who had made it into the country and those who had not. The government had been ordered to turn over a list of anyone who, from 9:37 p.m. on Jan. 28 to a minute before midnight on Jan. 29, had been \u201cheld, including being processed, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection pursuant to the [Executive Order].\u201d The parties agreed not to make the list public. Gelernt said civil liberties lawyers also had identified 10 people it believes should have been on the list but were not, and the government agreed to investigate why. The government has offered conflicting numbers of people affected by the executive order before. Earlier this month, a Justice Department lawyer declared more than 100,000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of it, while the State Department said the figure was actually 60,000. Officials ultimately agreed on the State Department\u2019s count. That figure, rather than the number detained or processed, is a more accurate assessment of the executive order\u2019s impact, reflecting all those whose travel would be affected. Federal courts have now put Trump\u2019s travel ban on hold, and Trump has said he plans to issue a rewritten executive order. The ACLU had sought the list of 746 people as part of an effort to identify those whose travel was affected while that suspension was in place, particularly those who might have been removed from the country. In an earlier court filing, Todd A. Hoffman, a Customs and Border Protection official, declared that 141 people had their visas physically marked \u201crevoked\u201d after the ban went into effect \u2014 44 at U.S. airports and another 97 at locations abroad. The 44 at U.S. airports, he wrote, \u201cvoluntarily withdrew their applications for admission to the United States and returned to a foreign destination on an outbound flight,\u201d but 24 had since traveled back and been allowed into the country. All of the 97 stopped at foreign locations also withdrew their applications, though 14 had since been allowed back in, Hoffman wrote.

On Thursday \u2014 for the 12th day in a row \u2014 the White House defended Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that his predecessor, Barack Obama, ordered wiretaps of Trump\u2019s New York City offices during the presidential campaign, despite a growing chorus of declarations from intelligence officials and members of Congress that nothing of the sort happened.

[Federal judge halts Trump travel ban hours before it was to take effect] Trump boosters say his freewheeling rhetoric, in person and on social media, is a large part of his appeal and has kept him in good stead with his political base. But it is also making governing more challenging. In recent weeks, Trump has pledged that he would provide \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d at a lower cost, setting an impossible standard for congressional Republicans as they seek to craft a bill to scale back Obama\u2019s signature health-care law. Trump has sent conflicting signals on whether he supports a \u201cborder adjustment tax,\u201d a key component of efforts to reduce taxes that has divided Republicans in the House and Senate who are eager for Trump\u2019s guidance. The president\u2019s repeated pronouncements of admiration for Russian leader Vladi\u00admir Putin have forced his ambassador to the United Nations and his secretary of state to reassure allies by talking tougher about an adversary blamed for meddling in last year\u2019s U.S. election. (Reuters) And Trump\u2019s allegations on Twitter \u2014 without citing any evidence \u2014 that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower last year has eaten up investigative resources in Congress and chipped away at his credibility among GOP leaders key to advancing the president\u2019s ambitious agenda. But perhaps nowhere have Trump\u2019s words been as damaging as his attempts to implement the travel ban \u2014 which may have been damaged further by Trump\u2019s remarks at his Nashville rally. Trump inflamed controversy during the campaign by calling for a temporary ban on all foreign Muslims from entering the United States, then later shifted to vague pledges to ban people from countries with a history of Islamist terrorism. \u201cI am sure that challengers will use the president\u2019s comments last night as further evidence that the true intent of his executive order is to bar Muslim immigration,\u201d said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School. [Trump \u2018stands by\u2019 unproven allegation that Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump Tower] In rulings halting both the first and second attempts at a ban, judges have cited comments by Trump and his close advisers as evidence of the administration\u2019s intent to target Muslims in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution \u2014 even as lawyers for Trump insist that is not the case. The somewhat narrower version of the ban put on hold Wednesday would have temporarily barred the issuance of new visas to citizens of six \u00adMuslim-majority countries and suspended the admission of new refugees. Early Thursday, a federal judge in Maryland issued a second injunction against the measure, suspending only the portion that stopped the issuance of visas. While some legal experts say Trump still has a strong chance of prevailing at the Supreme Court, based on arguments about executive powers, others have questioned whether comments coming from his administration have made it impossible to credibly argue that the ban is secular in nature. Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University, said Trump and his advisers \u201cseem to be validating the court\u2019s concerns every chance they get.\u201d \u201cThey seem not to know when they need to keep their mouths shut,\u201d said Elleithee, who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. The proposed policy can be traced back to December 2015, when Trump \u2014 reading in dramatic fashion at a campaign rally \u2014 called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d The statement is still available on Trump\u2019s campaign website. Later in the campaign, amid continuing uproar, Trump began referring to the ban as being aimed at particular nations rather than a religious group. But at times he also disputed the idea that the proposal had changed or narrowed. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rollback,\u201d Trump said in July 2016. \u201cIn fact, you could say it\u2019s an expansion. I\u2019m looking now at territories. People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t use the word Muslim.\u2019 . . . And I\u2019m okay with that, because I\u2019m talking territory instead of Muslim.\u201d Also undermining the administration\u2019s claim of secular intent was Trump\u2019s statement on the Christian Broadcasting Network on Jan. 27 \u2014 just before the first ban went into place \u2014 that he saw persecuted Christians as a priority in accepting refugees. And when he actually signed the measure, Trump declared: \u201cThis is the protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means.\u201d He did not explain further. The next day, a close Trump adviser, Rudolph W. Giuliani, appeared on Fox News and seemed to offer an explanation. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole history of it,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cSo when [Trump] first announced it, he said, \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 He called me up. He said, \u2018Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.\u2019 \u201d In his blistering 43-page opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii referred to those comments as well as a recent Fox News appearance by Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who said the second attempt at a ban would have \u201cmostly minor technical differences\u201d and that Americans would see \u201cthe same basic policy outcome for the country.\u201d At Wednesday night\u2019s rally in Nashville, Trump took aim at Watson and suggested there was little difference between the intent of his first executive order and his second. \u201cThe order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with,\u201d Trump said. During a news briefing Thursday, Spicer said the administration had \u201ctailored\u201d the second order to address concerns raised about the first and said he was confident the president would ultimately prevail. Spicer said comments made by Trump and his aides, including those on Twitter, were \u201cnon-germane\u201d and \u201cnot in keeping with how [judges] are supposed to interpret the law.\u201d Leon Fresco, the deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation in Obama\u2019s Justice Department, said anything the president or those in his administration say now will likely become part of the ongoing litigation. The strongest evidence the challengers have to prove Trump intended the ban to disfavor Muslims, rather than protect national security, comes from the president\u2019s own words and those of his close advisers, he said. But Fresco said it is possible Trump would ultimately prevail at the Supreme Court. In particular, he said, the judge in Hawaii had not addressed head-on whether Trump and his advisers\u2019 comments \u201cirrevocably stain the ability to ever issue an order like this, period.\u201d The Justice Department has argued that the comments by Trump and his advisers should not be considered because, in the department\u2019s view, the courts should not look beyond official statements and the order itself to determine its purpose. Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said Trump had an opportunity after he was elected to set a different course but has not. \u201cAs president, he should have said he was wrong to advocate for a Muslim ban,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cHe\u2019s never done that.

In a news conference at the White House, Trump said the new order would \u201ccomprehensively protect our country,\u201d and he hinted that it might contain new vetting measures for travelers. Trump\u2019s first order temporarily barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from entering the United States, ostensibly so officials could review and tighten screening procedures. \u201cExtreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places,\u201d Trump said. He said the administration \u201chad to go quicker than we thought\u201d because a federal appeals court refused to lift the suspension on his travel ban. [4 ways the Trump administration could fight for its travel ban] The president\u2019s comments and the Justice Department\u2019s request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit mean that the administration \u2014 at least for now \u2014 is pumping the brakes on the furious court battle to restore the travel ban. Instead, the administration indicated in its filing that it expects that a revamped executive order will eliminate judges\u2019 concerns, even those the Justice Department views as unfounded. The 9th Circuit agreed late Thursday to wait until a new order was issued to potentially reconsider the matter before a larger group of judges. (Reuters) Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had successfully sued to block the travel ban, wrote on Twitter that the Justice Department filing, in particular, \u201crecognizes the obvious \u2014 the President\u2019s current Exec Order violates the Constitution.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump could have sought review of this flawed Order in the Supreme Court but declined to face yet another defeat,\u201d Ferguson wrote. The legal wrangling, though, is far from over, and even a new executive order will not necessarily end the need for it. What happens next will largely depend on how significantly the rewritten order departs from the original. Justice Department lawyers wrote that the revisions would be meaningful. \u201cRather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the Order and replace it with a new, substantially revised Executive Order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cIn so doing, the President will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially time-consuming litigation.\u201d Trump could make clear that his order no longer applies to green-card holders \u2014 who probably have the strongest case to sue \u2014 or he could craft an order that would affect only people who have not yet applied for visas. But a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said even those modifications would not necessarily persuade them to lift a suspension of the ban, because such changes would not help U.S. citizens who \u201chave an interest in specific noncitizens\u2019 ability to travel to the United States.\u201d Lee Gelernt, who is deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project and is involved in another legal challenge to Trump\u2019s order in federal court in New York, said it is difficult to assess a new order without seeing it, \u201cbut I think any type of ban is going to be legally problematic, and I also don\u2019t think that the taint of religious discrimination is going to go away.\u201d The original executive order, signed Jan. 27, barred refugees from entering the country for 120 days; citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days; and citizens of Syria indefinitely. A federal judge in Seattle first ordered the ban suspended Feb. 3, and the three-judge panel with the 9th Circuit last week unanimously rejected the administration\u2019s request to undo that freeze. That left Justice Department lawyers with two options in the short run: rush immediately to the Supreme Court, or ask the full 9th Circuit to take up the matter in what is known as a rehearing \u201cen banc.\u201d They had yet to make a choice when a judge on the 9th Circuit asked the judges to take a vote on their own, and the circuit\u2019s chief judge asked the parties to file their positions on the matter by Thursday. The Justice Department, representing the Trump administration, argued in its filing that the three-judge panel was wrong, but \u2014 given that a new executive order was coming anyway \u2014 the 9th Circuit should hold off on taking up the matter en banc. Washington state and Minnesota, which are suing over the ban, also argued against en banc consideration, but they asserted that the three-judge panel got it right. At issue has not been whether Trump\u2019s ban is ultimately legal \u2014 although that has been part of the consideration. The judges have been asked to consider only whether national security concerns necessitate an immediate restoration of the travel ban, when weighed against the economic and other harms Washington and Minnesota officials say it is imposing on their states. The president has broad authority to set immigration policy, but federal judges nationwide have ruled against Trump\u2019s particular travel ban. This week, a federal judge in Virginia handed down perhaps the most stinging rebuke of the executive order, declaring that there was evidence that it was motivated not by national security concerns but instead by \u201creligious prejudice\u201d toward Muslims.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-02-16", "authors": ["matt.zapotosky"], "type": "article", "author_string": "matt zapotosky"}, {"title": "Constitutional crisis?

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) President Trump has spent the better part of the past 24 hours bashing a U.S. district judge's decision to temporarily halt his travel ban executive order. First came a White House statement calling the ruling \u201coutrageous\u201d (the word was later taken out). Then came Trump's many tweets, which were scattered throughout the day Saturday and actually seemed to question the judge's authority. And then, in its appeal, the Trump administration said the lower-court judge shouldn't be \u201csecond-guessing\u201d the president. The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 Update: Trump continued his assault on the \"court system\" Sunday afternoon: Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 The administration is complying with the order. But Trump's increasingly alarming tweets and this type of rhetoric about the judge's authority leads us to a question: What if it didn't? What if Trump \u2014 or any president \u2014 decided too much was at stake or that he didn't recognize \u201cthis so-called judge's\u201d authority? It's something experts on executive authority have been chewing over. Given Trump's populist campaign, admiration for authoritarian leaders and expressed skepticism toward the political establishment, some think it's possible he takes on the judicial establishment, too. \u201cThey're spoiling for a fight, and that\u2019s what populists do,\u201d said Daniel P. Franklin, a professor at Georgia State University. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the way it plays out \u2014 maybe not on this issue, but on something.\u201d I'll emphasize up front that the Trump administration has given no indication that they'll actually ignore this particular court order \u2014 or any other. (They're appealing, and the 9th Circuit declined to immediately reinstate the ban early Sunday morning.) Franklin said he's not aware of when a president \u201cpurposely ignored a direct court order.\u201d But sometimes presidents have interpreted court decisions in ways that lead to discord between branches of government, leading to the threat of constitutional crises. The most oft-cited example of a president allegedly ignoring a court ruling involves the populist president that Trump's team seems most interested in comparing to Trump: Andrew Jackson. After the Supreme Court and Justice John Marshall struck down a Georgia law that allowed for the seizure of Native American lands, saying it violated federal treaties, Jackson ignored it or at least initially declined to get involved \u2014 depending upon the account. He is remembered to have said, \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it,\u201d though there is debate about the accuracy of that quote. According to Native American scholar Frank Pommersheim: While others consider the statement apocryphal, there is no doubt that President Jackson supported Georgia's claimed sovereignty over Cherokee land. The constitutional imbroglio was only averted when the impending nullification crisis convinced President Jackson that such a constitutional crisis was not in the national interest. An earlier and plainer example also involved Marshall \u2014 and a Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson. Jeffrey Rosen wrote for PBS that a showdown between the two pitted Jefferson's views against Marshall's view of the Supreme Court's purview: The culmination of Marshall's national vision came in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), in which he wrote an opinion for a unanimous Court upholding Congress' power to charter the Bank of the United States. Marshall resurrected the same arguments that Alexander Hamilton had used to persuade George Washington to charter the bank over Jefferson's objections: namely, that the Constitution gives Congress the authority to pass all laws \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d for executing its constitutional powers, and that those words should be construed broadly, in a practical spirit. \u2026 Although the decision was popular in the middle and Northern states, it precipitated a backlash against the Court in the Southern and Western states. Jefferson's reaction to McCulloch was especially peevish and extreme. He endorsed attacks on the decision published by the radical states' rights partisans Spencer Roane and John Taylor, agreeing that the Supreme Court had no power to review the constitutionality of state laws or to second-guess the decisions of state courts. Later, he seemed to deny entirely the Supreme Court's power to hand down binding interpretations of the Constitution. This proved too radical for Jefferson's protege, James Madison, who wrote to his patron that he had no doubt that the framers of the Constitution intended the federal courts to be a final arbiter of conflicts between federal and state law. On his deathbed, just before he expired on July 4, 1826, Jefferson criticized Madison for being too accommodating. Another potential parallel involves Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War: John Merryman, a state legislator from Maryland, is arrested for attempting to hinder Union troops from moving from Baltimore to Washington during the Civil War and is held at Fort McHenry by Union military officials. His attorney immediately sought a writ of habeas corpus so that a federal court could examine the charges. However, President Abraham Lincoln decided to suspend the right of habeas corpus, and the general in command of Fort McHenry refused to turn Merryman over to the authorities. Federal judge Roger Taney, the chief justice of the Supreme Court (and also the author of the infamous Dred Scott decision), issued a ruling that President Lincoln did not have the authority to suspend habeas corpus. Lincoln didn\u2019t respond, appeal, or order the release of Merryman. But during a July 4 speech, Lincoln was defiant, insisting that he needed to suspend the rules in order to put down the rebellion in the South. Five years later, a new Supreme Court essentially backed Justice Taney\u2019s ruling: In an unrelated case, the court held that only Congress could suspend habeas corpus and that civilians were not subject to military courts, even in times of war. If Trump were to ever go down this road, Franklin said, the ultimate arbiter would be the other branch of government. He said Trump could be held in contempt of court, and it would then be up to the House of Representatives. \"[Contempt of court], in my opinion, is a 'high crime or misdemeanor' in the meaning of the Constitution, and he would be subject to impeachment,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cWhether or not the House of Representatives would see it that way is another question. It is at that point their call.\u201d Before we got to that point, though, we'd likely see wrangling between the judge and not Trump but the government officials working beneath him, said Joel Nichols, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas. \u201cThe key to whether court orders are going to be obeyed isn\u2019t about what President Trump does, but about how the judges respond to noncompliance and whether other non-Trump players decide to obey their orders,\u201d Nichols said. A judge would have to issue a \u201cshow cause\u201d order if officials didn't seem to be obeying the order. If they still didn't obey, they could be held in contempt, and federal marshals could be dispatched to force them to do so or face jail time \u2014 which could also constitute a crisis. \u201cI think that some federal judges would be willing to issue a contempt order against [Trump], but I\u2019m not sure they should or would, and they don\u2019t need to,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cThey only need to issue specific orders about laws and regulations, and then hold other government officials in contempt for not following the court order.\u201d Which gets to the other big question with Trump, should he opt to question the legal authority of a judge who runs afoul of him: whether the government agencies who would need to go along with Trump's decision would actually do so. Trump's defense and homeland security secretaries, for example, are military generals who are accustomed to a chain of command. Would they ignore a court order in favor of their boss, Trump? It's all very hypothetical, but Trump's rhetoric \u2014 not just about the judge's decision, but the judge's actual authority \u2014 and his apparent desire to press his case for his own authority suggest it's not out of the question. 1 of 83 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 A look at President Trump\u2019s first 100 days View Photos The beginning of the president\u2019s term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

Alison Duffy, another school spokeswoman, said Partopour, a PhD student in chemical engineering, had been working on a project in Germany but had returned to Iran to renew his visa. She said she believed he had not previously attempted to come back to the country, mindful that he might be stopped by the executive order. \u201cWe just want this student back here doing his work,\u201d Duffy said.

After Trump\u2019s order, the State Department revoked all valid nonimmigrant and immigrant visas of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In a letter, Edward J. Ramotowski, State Department deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of Consular Affairs, said the revocation would not apply to \u201cany visa exempted on the basis of a determination made by the secretaries of State and Homeland Security,\u201d and those exemptions would be determined \u201con a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest.\u201d The airline Lufthansa had posted on its website Thursday night a vague notice that Trump\u2019s executive order was \u201csuspended\u201d on flights to Boston, where a federal court had declared that \u2014 at least until Sunday \u2014 no one was to be detained or removed who \u201cabsent the executive order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States.\u201d The airline, though, said that only those with \u201cvalid travel documents\u201d would be eligible to board. That would apparently not be the case for the tens of thousands of people whose visas were revoked. Lufthansa later removed the language about the executive order being suspended. [Homeland Security inspector general will review implementation of Trump immigration ban] Christina Semmel, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa, declined to comment on when the airline began allowing travel to Boston. She said Lufthansa was simply following guidance it and other carriers had received from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. \u201cThe airline community commenced transporting passengers and accepting bookings after CPB confirmed it was abiding by the Massachusetts court order,\u201d she said.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) When President Trump signed an executive order Friday temporarily barring residents of seven countries from entry to the United States, he was doing something that shouldn't have been hugely controversial. A poll earlier this month, in fact, showed that about half of Americans liked the idea \u2014 at least in its broad strokes. The Quinnipiac poll showed that 48 percent supported \"suspending immigration from 'terror prone' regions, even if it means turning away refugees from those regions.\" Fewer \u2014 42 percent \u2014 opposed it. And yet here we are, with plenty of Republicans revolting over the travel ban and the Trump administration having to play all kinds of defense. The situation is a near-perfect example of Trump's penchant for turning political molehills into mountains and flat land into molehills. Through a combination of Trump's controversial rhetoric, a lack of thorough preparation and a frenzied implementation, he's turned a policy that Republicans support by a margin of 72 to 17 percent into something dozens of Republican members of Congress cannot support. I know we all like to search for Trump's secret political genius in stuff like this, but that's called an unforced error. Trump's team will undoubtedly ascribe this resistance to the media's coverage of the travel ban, which they say has been unfairly cast as a ban on all Muslims. That idea, of course, originated with Trump himself back in December 2015, and his rhetoric in the intervening months makes his banning of travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries very difficult to completely divorce from that early proposal. White House press secretary Sean Spicer addressed the media on Jan. 30, three days after President Trump signed an executive order halting the flow of refugees to the United States. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) And the more that debate wears on, the worse it is for Trump. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in mid-January showed that, by a 2-to-1 margin, Americans opposed \"banning most Muslims who are not U.S. citizens from entering the United States.\" In other words, insofar as this is viewed as a Muslim ban, it's unpopular. Insofar as it's viewed as focusing on terror-prone countries, it's on firmer ground. Which is why its defenders are so adamant on this point. But here's the key: While the Democratic opposition is focused on the religious implications of the executive order, that's not really what Republicans are worried about. Most GOP critics aren't citing the appearance of a religious test; they're talking about implementation and the lack of a heads-up. \"You have an extreme vetting proposal that didn't get the vetting it should have had,\" Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) \u2014 a perhaps unlikely opponent in ruby-red Kansas \u2014 added in a stern statement that \"far-reaching national security policy should always be devised in consultation with Congress and relevant government agencies.\" Trump's White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said Monday that the Trump team couldn't keep agencies and Congress in the loop because of the national security implications \u2014 which is an interesting defense. And this is really where the Trump executive order went off the rails. This is where it alienated Republicans. When green-card holders and those who helped the United States fight terrorism abroad were denied entry, it became a PR problem. And right now only three Republicans senators are on the record as clearly supporting the travel ban. When Trump is losing people like Moran, he's in trouble. Political analysts are always in search of some strategy behind what a politician is doing, and they continue to theorize that Trump's approach is a deliberately scorched-earth one; so do Trump critics who insist on seeing Machiavellian genius behind virtually every move he makes. Perhaps, say some, it's an effort to make himself more popular by purposefully botching something and hoping the media overreacts. Or maybe it's just causing a ton of controversy early on in order to lower the bar for the rest of his presidency. Or maybe it's simply that the construction and implementation of the executive order was just poorly handled.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-01-30", "authors": ["aaronblakewp"], "type": "article", "author_string": "aaron blake"}, {"title": "George Conway: President\u2019s tweets \u2018certainly won\u2019t help\u2019 court case over travel ban", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/george-conway-presidents-tweets-certainly-wont-help-court-case-over-travel-ban/2017/06/05/d78c8102-4a08-11e7-9669-250d0b15f83b_story.html", "text": "After President Trump tweeted about his controversial travel ban Monday morning, plenty of people quickly pointed out that he probably was hurting his case.

Lawyers in the division had actually been defending the president\u2019s travel bans, although as the legal wrangling reached the appeals courts, Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall argued the cases in court. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Conway cited timing as the reason he could not take the job, and he said he was happy to have been considered. \u201cI am profoundly grateful to the President and to the Attorney General for selecting me to serve in the Department of Justice. I have reluctantly concluded, however, that, for me and my family, this is not the right time for me to leave the private sector and take on a new role in the federal government,\u201d Conway said in a statement. \u201cKellyanne and I continue to support the President and his Administration, and I look forward to doing so in whatever way I can from outside the government.\u201d Kellyanne Conway is one of the Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters, appearing on television frequently to tirelessly support the president\u2019s policies. She told Fox News Channel earlier this year that she thought the president\u2019s revised travel ban would \u201cpass legal muster,\u201d and on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Monday, she defended the order again, deriding what she called \u201cthis obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.\u201d She added later: \u201cThis president, through his travel ban, is trying to do something to protect the people of this country.\u201d George Conway did not criticize the ban itself, instead focusing on the president\u2019s remarks as possibly hurting the case to restore it. Later, he added on Twitter: \u201cI still VERY, VERY STRONGLY support POTUS, his Admin, policies, the executive order and of course, my wonderful wife. \u201cWhich is why I said what I said this morning,\u201d he added. \u201cEvery sensible lawyer in WHCO and every political appointee at DOJ wd agree with me (as some have already told me). The pt cannot be stressed enough that tweets on legal matters seriously undermine Admin agenda and POTUS \u2014 and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce that pt and not be shy about it.\u201d Federal judges have consistently cited Trump\u2019s public comments in ordering the travel ban frozen, determining that his statements show that his intent in signing the directive was not to protect national security, but rather to discriminate against Muslims.

Yates wrote that, as the leader of the Justice Department, she must ensure the department\u2019s position is both \u201clegally defensible\u201d and \u201cconsistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. \u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\u201d Yates wrote.

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Tuesday on President Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), whose views align much more closely with the president\u2019s. Meanwhile, President Trump continued on Monday to adamantly defend his order, despite mounting criticism, legal challenges and questions that stretched from Capitol Hill to the United Nations. Trump\u2019s order has sparked protests from coast to coast, court cases challenging its constitutionality, unease in cities worldwide and a host of questions about the limits of its scope. Even as the White House remained defiant, former president Barack Obama became the latest high-profile voice to weigh in on the issue, offering his first public criticism of his successor while backing protesters. The ban\u2019s impact continued to reverberate around the world. The United Nations said that some 20,000 refugees could be affected by the 120-day suspension of refugee admission. Lawyers sought to confirm how many people remain detained in the United States, while a lawsuit argued that dozens of people may have been forced to give up their green cards by Customs and Border Protection agents. [Trump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn\u2019t have prevented] Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said the situation at airports remains \u201cchaotic and fluid.\u201d Lawyers are \u201chaving trouble independently verifying anything because the government will not provide full access to all the detainees,\u201d he said. Gelernt said that by Monday afternoon, no list of detainees had been turned over, adding that the ACLU could be back in court within a day to get the list so it could obtain more definitive information. On Monday, in what could be the first volley in an intense legal battle, Bob Ferguson, Washington state\u2019s attorney general, said he plans to file a federal lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to the order\u2019s implementation. Ferguson is the first state official to declare plans to file such a suit, but he may not be the last. A day earlier, Ferguson joined 15 other state attorneys general in calling the measure unconstitutional. Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who joined in that message, is reviewing possible options, \u201cand that could certainly include litigation,\u201d Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman, said Monday. [Some international passengers entering the U.S. more easily, but members of Congress say they\u2019re still not getting answers] White House officials have played down the anger and chaos over the order, holding a briefing with reporters Sunday evening to argue that the rollout was \u201ca massive success story.\u201d On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the ban and its implementation. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when the next attack\u2019s coming,\u201d he said during the briefing. \u201cAnd so the best you can do is to get ahead of it because if you wait, you\u2019re going to be reacting. And what I think I want to be clear on is the president\u2019s not going wait. He\u2019s going to make sure he does everything in his power when he can to protect the homeland and its people.\u201d Trump\u2019s order was followed by two days of intense protests at airport terminals across the country, meaning both weekends of his presidency so far have been marked by heavy public demonstrations against him. In his now-customary morning tweets, Trump blamed others for the disorganized implementation and sought to minimize its impact on travelers. Trump claimed that \u201cbig problems at airports\u201d were caused by the demonstrators themselves, an airline\u2019s technical problems and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who teared up while discussing the ban.

Hours later, Obama \u2014 who had not weighed in on Trump since leaving office 10 days ago \u2014 endorsed the protests that have emerged nationwide and rejected his successor\u2019s attempt to link the travel ban to the Obama administration. Obama feels \u201cheartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\u201d Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for the former president, said in a statement. \u201cCitizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\u201d Alluding to Trump\u2019s questionable claim that his ban was based on Obama administration decisions, Lewis said the former president \u201cfundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d [Scholars: Many more legal challenges likely for Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration] A group of former U.S. officials who served under presidents of both parties wrote a letter released to Politico asking the Trump administration to rescind the order, calling it \u201cinhumane, unnecessary and counterproductive from a security standpoint.\u201d On Capitol Hill, Democrats sought to capitalize on the growing public outcry and said they were hoping to pass legislation rescinding the ban and planning to delay confirmation votes for Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. Some Republicans have also spoken out against the ban, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.), top defense hawks who issued a joint statement bluntly worrying that the order could \u201cbecome a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d Criticism also emerged in other quarters. State Department diplomats have been circulating a document objecting to Trump\u2019s order since he announced it Friday. According to a draft version of the memo, first reported by the Lawfare blog, the dissenters say the ban will not deter attacks on American soil, but will generate ill will toward U.S. citizens. [Jihadist groups hail Trump\u2019s travel ban as a victory] Iraqi parliament leaders called for retaliatory visa restrictions on American citizens, while a petition called on Britain to cancel a planned state visit by Trump amid the furor. In a statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expressed concern about \u201cthe uncertainty facing thousands of refugees around the world who are in the process of being resettled to the United States.\u201d According to the agency, more than 800 refugees were set to go to America this week but are barred, and the 120-day halt on refugee resettlement could impact as many as 20,000 refugees. \u201cRefugees are anxious, confused and heartbroken at this suspension in what is already a lengthy process,\u201d the agency said. [Officials worry that U.S counterterrorism defenses will be weakened by Trump actions] In airports around the world, sorrow and relief mixed together as travelers entered an unknown future. Trump\u2019s virtually unprecedented executive action applies to travelers and U.S. legal residents from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen, and to refugees from around the world. People subject to the ban include dual nationals born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies. At Dulles International Airport, lawyers and Democratic members of Congress were unable to get information from Customs officials. Late Sunday, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) said he was told there were no people in Customs custody at Dulles. Dozens of demonstrators gathered at Dulles to welcome international visitors, joining volunteer lawyers who gathered to monitor any potential problems. [Share your thoughts on the travel ban] Customs agents at Dulles forced lawful permanent U.S. residents to give up their green cards this weekend, according to a complaint filed Monday in federal court in Alexandria. Tareq Aqel Mohammed Aziz and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz were flying from Yemen to the United States. Both had been granted immigrant visas because their father, who lives in Flint, Mich., is a U.S. citizen. When they arrived at Dulles Saturday morning, the Aziz brothers were handcuffed and their immigration paperwork was seized, according to the complaint. They were given documents to sign and allegedly told that if they did not, they would be removed from the United States and barred from coming back for five years. They were not allowed to see attorneys. Under pressure, their attorneys said, they signed documents they did not understand, giving up their American visas, and agents stamped \u201ccancelled\u201d on those visas. Attorneys are asking for their visas to be returned, the forms they signed to be invalidated and for them to be returned to the United States. Attorneys said they believe it is possible that many of 50 to 60 other legal permanent residents at Dulles were likewise tricked into giving up their status there. The lawyers said they hope to learn the identities of those individuals through the discovery process. The Aziz brothers were compelled to buy tickets, at their own expense, for a flight back to Ethiopia, and when they arrived, their passports were confiscated, leaving them in limbo. Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said anyone with a valid visa should be able to enter the United States, even if they are abroad, and the ACLU is working to investigate reports that this is not happening. In the long run, Romero said, ACLU lawyers will work to get the executive order thrown out permanently, and they will seek to have its implementation delayed while they press their case. This court battle could take years, he said. Romero said they believe the executive order violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, some ratified treaties and \u2014 perhaps most acutely \u2014 the First Amendment, because it seems to target Muslims. The order\u2019s exception for those from minority religions in majority-Muslim countries \u201cis clearly the smoking gun that this has targeted individuals of the Muslim faith.\u201d \u201cThat dooms it from a First Amendment perspective, in our view,\u201d Romero said. The Council on American\u2010Islamic Relations on Monday filed a sweeping challenge to the executive order, alleging its \u201cpurpose is to initiate the mass expulsion of immigrant and non-immigrant Muslims lawfully residing in the United States.\u201d The lawsuit lists 27 plaintiffs, some of them activists and council officials and others students with visas, lawful permanent residents, refugees and others who allege Trump\u2019s order will deny them citizenship or prevent them from traveling abroad and returning home. [Here\u2019s where Republicans stand on the travel ban] Among them is a doctor who the suit alleges is working in an underserved area in the United States. \u201cIn the event he is prevented from returning to the United States, the area he serves will be lacking an essential physician to provide critical care to a substantial population in the United States,\u201d the lawsuit says. Gadeir Abbas, who joined with others to file the suit, said the lawyers are \u201cconfident that we can win, and fortunately, President Trump and those around him make it very easy to reveal that bigotry. They can\u2019t keep their mouths shut.\u201d Department of Homeland Security officials said the executive order does apply to green-card holders, who may be let into the country with a waiver. The directors of each large port of entry, such as airports, have the authority to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a green-card holder may be admitted. Since Friday, dozens of green-card holders at large airports in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been admitted, officials said. The officials also said Friday\u2019s confusion has abated in these large airports because people subject to the ban are not being permitted to board flights overseas and so are not arriving at American airports. In Seattle, two men whose visas were revoked and who were put on plane to be deported were allowed to enter the United States after a federal judge issued an emergency ruling in their favor, said Matt Adams, the men\u2019s lawyer. Adams said the men \u2014 one an engineer from Sudan who was coming to the United States for a conference, the other a visitor from Yemen who was coming to see family \u2014 \u201cliterally had to get pulled off the plane as they were deporting them.\u201d The men dropped their lawsuit after they were allowed to enter the United States, Adams said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is now with the national stay in effect, if anyone were to arrive, then the government\u2019s precluded from trying to immediately deport them like they were doing on Saturday,\u201d Adams said. However, Adams said more lawsuits were likely, noting the number of people getting stopped as they tried to board planes abroad. The Department of Homeland Security said that \u201cless than one percent\u201d of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by the executive order \u2014 though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country was one of widespread uncertainty and disorder at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained. Trump wrote on Twitter that Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly \u201csaid that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\u201d In other messages, Trump again cast his order as necessary to protect the country: There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country.

(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) A federal appeals court panel on Thursday ruled to maintain the freeze on President Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order, meaning that previously barred refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries can continue entering the United States. Here are seven big take-aways from their unanimous, 29-page opinion. 1. The three judges think that they are well within their rights to check the president\u2019s authority on matters of immigration and national security, and the government\u2019s suggestion to the contrary is undemocratic. \u201cInstead, the Government has taken the position that the President\u2019s decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections. The Government indeed asserts that it violates separation of powers for the judiciary to entertain a constitutional challenge to executive actions such as this one. There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.\u201d 2. The court isn\u2019t buying \u2014 as Trump has suggested \u2014 that the impact of the order was limited to extra vetting for 109 people. \u201cThe impact of the Executive Order was immediate and widespread. It was reported that thousands of visas were immediately canceled, hundreds of travelers with such visas were prevented from boarding airplanes bound for the United States or denied entry on arrival, and some travelers were detained.\u201d 3. The court thinks that the states of Washington and Minnesota have actual harms they can sue over. \u201cSpecifically, the States allege that the teaching and research missions of their universities are harmed by the Executive Order\u2019s effect on their faculty and students who are nationals of the seven affected countries. These students and faculty cannot travel for research, academic collaboration, or for personal reasons, and their families abroad cannot visit. Some have been stranded outside the country, unable to return to the universities at all. The schools cannot consider attractive student candidates and cannot hire faculty from the seven affected countries, which they have done in the past.\u201d 4. The court isn\u2019t sure \u2014 at this stage \u2014 whether there is proof that the executive order discriminates against Muslims. \u201cThe States\u2019 claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions. In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the Government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed.\u201d 5. The court doesn\u2019t think the government needs to immediately reinstate the ban to protect national security. \u201cThe Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree, as explained above.\u201d 6. The government says green-card holders aren\u2019t impacted by the order anymore because of guidance from the White House counsel. The court says it can\u2019t take that to the bank. \u201cNor has the Government established that the White House counsel\u2019s interpretation of the Executive Order is binding on all executive branch officials responsible for enforcing the Executive Order. The White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments. Moreover, in light of the Government\u2019s shifting interpretations of the Executive Order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.\u201d 7. The court wouldn\u2019t even give the government its fallback position \u2014 a modification of the earlier judge\u2019s suspension of the ban. \u201cMore generally, even if the [temporary restraining order] might be overbroad in some respects, it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order. The political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions. For now, it is enough for us to conclude that the Government has failed to establish that it will likely succeed on its due process argument in this appeal.\u201d A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling suspending President Trump's controversial immigration order barring refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. The White House said on Feb. 10 that it is \"reviewing all options,\" including possibly going to the Supreme Court.

Gregory of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. (Steve Helber/AP) A substantial majority of the judges who sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond delivered a rather remarkable judgment last week: The president of the United States is not to be believed. Will the Supreme Court conclude the same thing? And by \u201cSupreme Court,\u201d we mean \u201cJustice Anthony M. Kennedy,\u201d whose name was invoked 23 times in the 205 pages of majority opinions, concurrences and dissents in the appeals court\u2019s 10-to-3 rejection of President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban. [Appeals court won\u2019t revive Trump\u2019s travel ban] It appears that we will find out \u2014 the president\u2019s lawyers are likely to ask the high court this week to overturn the 4th Circuit opinion. Perhaps the administration will find a more receptive audience at 1 First Street than it has to date for the argument that judicial attempts to peer into the chief executive\u2019s motivations are inappropriate. But it\u2019s worth another look at the remarkable rhetoric in Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory\u2019s majority opinion, which concludes that Trump\u2019s \u201ctrue reason\u201d for the travel ban was not protecting the nation\u2019s security but making good on a campaign promise born of anti-Muslim bias. As Harvard law professor Noah Feldman put it in an essay for Bloomberg News, \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary for a federal court to tell the president directly that he\u2019s lying; I certainly can\u2019t think of any other examples in my lifetime.\u201d Gregory\u2019s 79-page opinion, joined in full by six judges, opens with the finding that Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cdrips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.\u201d He devotes a large section to recounting Trump campaign rhetoric, tweets and website postings about imposing a ban on Muslims entering the country. [Trump and his advisers can\u2019t keep quiet, and it\u2019s causing problems for him] Gregory noted an interview that Trump gave in 2016, when challenged about whether banning Muslims would be constitutional. \u201cPeople were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can\u2019t use the word Muslim,\u201d Trump said. \u201cRemember this. And I\u2019m okay with that, because I\u2019m talking territory instead of Muslim.\u201d \u201cJust as the reasonable observer\u2019s \u2018world is not made brand new every morning,\u2019 \u201d Gregory wrote, quoting from a Supreme Court precedent, \u201cnor are we able to awake without the vivid memory of these statements. \u201cWe cannot shut our eyes to such evidence when it stares us in the face, for \u2018there\u2019s none so blind as they that won\u2019t see.\u2019 \u201d Trump\u2019s first executive order, which Gregory called EO-1, was issued just a week after the president took office. It barred the entry of citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations (Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya), ordered a temporary halt to refu\u00adgee arrivals and would have eventually given preference to those who were religious minorities in their countries, such as Christians. Several judges and a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit shut it down. [Appeals court rules against Trump travel ban] Trump vowed to go to the Supreme Court that time, too, but eventually issued a new order, which Gregory called EO-2. The order removed Iraq from the list, deleted references to religion and added national security rationales for the policy. Gregory again doubted the president\u2019s motives. \u201cAny national security justification for EO-2 was secondary to its primary religious purpose and was offered as more of a \u2018litigating position\u2019 than as the actual purpose of EO-2,\u201d he wrote. The president\u2019s credibility took other hits in the 4th Circuit ruling in International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump. Judge Stephanie Thacker said she would not consider Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign but that he had said enough in his short time as president to reveal his true intentions. She called the revised order \u201cthe proverbial wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d Judge James A. Wynn Jr. seemed to think Gregory had not gone far enough in his rhetoric; Wynn invoked in his concurrence the lessons of slavery and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. \u201cWe again encounter the affront of invidious discrimination \u2014 this time layered under the guise of a President\u2019s claim of unfettered congressionally delegated authority to control immigration . . . Laid bare, this executive order is no more than what the President promised before and after his election: naked invidious discrimination against Muslims.\u201d The three dissenting judges \u2014 all were nominated to the appeals court by Republican presidents, while those in the majority were nominated by Democrats \u2014 seemed stunned not just by the boldness of their colleagues but by what has happened to their court, which was once one of the nation\u2019s most conservative. Judge Paul V. Niemeyer said the majority breezed past Supreme Court rulings that give the president enormous power to make immigration policy and decide who is allowed to enter the country. So long as the order is issued for a \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the [plaintiffs\u2019] First Amendment interests,\u201d the court has ruled. The majority compounded its error, Niemeyer wrote, by relying on the campaign statements. He welcomed the next round of review. \u201cThe Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority\u2019s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds \u2014 one that transforms the majority\u2019s criticisms of a candidate\u2019s various campaign statements into a constitutional violation\u201d he wrote. Which brings things back to Kennedy. He is the pivotal member of the court, the justice most often in the majority when the divided court decides a controversial issue. But he is especially important on this issue. In a 2015 case, Kennedy generally agreed with the rule that courts should not \u201clook behind\u201d immigration decisions. But, along with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., he said that an \u201caffirmative showing of bad faith,\u201d plausibly shown, might free courts to probe the rationale of a decision. It is hardly clear how the Supreme Court will react to a case that mixes profound questions about the president\u2019s power to protect the country, Congress\u2019s grant of authority to the executive branch to make immigration decisions and the Constitution\u2019s admonition that government not single out one religion for disparagement. Niemeyer said his colleagues seem to acknowledge that the same directive issued by a different president would be acceptable.

Here's a look at some of the protests that took place in airports and city squares across the U.S. after the order was signed. (Dalton Bennett,Erin Patrick O'Connor,Elyse Samuels,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) A familiar talking point has permeated the many Republican defenses of Donald Trump's controversial travel entry ban: It's not a \"Muslim ban.\" \"This is not a ban on Muslim refugees,\" Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.) assured. \u201cEverybody needs to take a deep breath; there is no litmus test based on religion,\" Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said. \u201cIt's simply wrong to call the president\u2019s executive order concerning immigration and refugees \u2018a religious test\u2019 of any kind,\" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) argued. Trump himself issued a statement Sunday saying the same: \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.\" For the record, non-ideological media outlets aren't flat-out calling it a Muslim ban \u2014 just noting that the opposition is making that argument. The executive order makes no explicit mention of a religion Islam, after all. (Correction: The order does mention religion, but not Islam specifically.) But it's unavoidable to note that the ban covers citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 the only seven countries it targets. And even some Republicans are suggesting that it amounts to a religious test, or at least worrying it has the appearance of one. For for that perception and story line, Trump has himself to thank. It was Trump, after all, who once actually did propose a Muslim ban. It's still on his campaign website, more than a year later: \"DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON PREVENTING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION.\" Then Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani took to Fox News on Saturday night and said Trump basically was shooting for a Muslim ban with his executive order but recognized it needed to be altered to pass muster. Fox News host Jeannine Pirro asked Giuliani, \u201cHow did the president decide the seven countries?\u201d \u201cI'll tell you the whole history of it,\" Giuliani said. \"So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.'\" Giuliani continued: \u201cAnd what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger \u2014 the areas of the world that create danger for us. Which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible. And that's what the ban is based on. It's not based on religion. It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.\u201d It's hard not to read Giuliani's comments as confirmation that a Muslim ban was the original intent, if not the final result. He's basically arguing it's not a Muslim ban because that wasn't practical. And given the particulars of the final result \u2014 even if not explicitly a religious test \u2014 it's not hard to draw a line between A and B. Trump's long-running commentary has also made clear that he believes Muslims should perhaps be treated differently in some way (though the actual proposals have shifted). A few examples: Asked about increasing surveillance of Muslims, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely. We\u2019re going to have to look at the mosques. We\u2019re going to have to look very, very carefully.\u201d Asked whether he would support a \u201cfull Muslim database,\u201d he said: \u201cBasically the suggestion was made and [is] certainly something we should start thinking about.\" Asked if he would rule out a database on all Muslims, he said no, but then shifted to talking about a database just of refugees. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a database for the refugees that \u2014 if they come into the country. We have no idea who these people are.\" And even as recently as this weekend, Trump again suggested a preference for Christian refugees over Muslim ones. Here's an exchange between him and the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody, which aired Saturday night: BRODY: Persecuted Christians, we\u2019ve talked about this, the refugees overseas. The refugee program, or the refugee changes you\u2019re looking to make. As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here? TRUMP: Yes. BRODY: You do? TRUMP: They\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim, you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible, and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them. The common thread running through these and many of Trump's comments about applying extra scrutiny to Muslims is that he's often asked about something specific, and tends to offer a generally positive response. The most charitable interpretation is that he's just trying to be agreeable. But the totality of Trump's comments on this make it impossible to divorce this issue from religion. He's gone to that well too many times, suggesting that it might be okay to single Muslims out \u2014 either for immigration, surveillance or a registry of some kind. Which is why you now see even some Republicans saying this looks way too much like a religious test. \"I am deeply troubled \u200eby the appearance of a religious ban,\" Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said Sunday night. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) added, \u201cIf we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion.\u201d Trump and his team will chalk that sort of criticism up to Republicans who don't much like him spouting off.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) questioned whether Yates was prepared to \"say no\" to the president if necessary. Yates was fired by President Trump Jan. 30, after refusing to enforce his controversial travel ban executive order. (Monica Akhtar,Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) Now-former acting attorney general Sally Yates cemented her place in liberal lore Monday by declining to enforce President Trump's travel ban, which opponents believe is unconstitutional and un-American. And to Democrats, Trump's decision to fire her for it is proof that he's an out-of-control despot bent on running over anybody who stands in his way \u2014 the law be damned. But is that really what happened here? The Yates firing is certainly a splashy story \u2014 stirring up all kinds of righteous indignation on the American left. But questions have arisen about just how appropriate her defiance was and how big a deal Trump's removal of her was. After Trump relieved Yates of her post Monday night, ProPublica President Richard Tofel weighed in with some perspective. Not a constitutional crisis for president to want his order defended. That would come if he defied court ruling that it is illegal. \u2014 Richard Tofel (@dicktofel) January 31, 2017 Meanwhile, over at the Lawfare blog, Jack Goldsmith, a George W. Bush administration counsel and current Harvard law professor, argued that Yates's reasons for defying Trump's travel ban were \u201cweak.\u201d Goldsmith acknowledges that Trump's executive order banning entrants from seven majority-Muslim countries was hasty and \u201cimprudent\u201d and that Yates is within her rights to make this call. But he says her actual reason for drawing a line in the sand doesn't stand up: The reasons that Yates then gives for deciding not to defend the EO [executive order] in court are labored and, to me, unconvincing. Most importantly, Yates does not say that she has concluded that the EO is unlawful. Nor does she say that defending the EO in court would be unreasonable. ... Yates states at the end of her letter that she is \u201cnot convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.\u201d This statement summarizes the two major points above. First, she believes the standard for defending the EO is \u201cbest view of the law,\u201d not reasonable legality, and she is not convinced the EO is consistent with the best view of the law. But as noted above, the typical standard for the Attorney General to defend an EO of the President is not whether she is convinced of its legality. Rather, the standard is something closer to the idea that she should defend the EO unless she is convinced of its illegality \u2014 i.e. she defends if there is a reasonable argument for its legality. Second, Yates believes that defending the EO is inconsistent with her responsibilities to interject a policy analysis about the wisdom and justness of the EO independent of the President. For reasons stated above, I do not believe that either of these arguments are persuasive given her role. Nor are they consistent with what I understand the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney General to be. Goldsmith concludes that Yates \u201cwrote a letter that appears to depart sharply from the usual criteria that an Attorney General would apply in deciding whether to defend an EO in court. As such, the letter seems like an act of insubordination that invites the President to fire her. Which he did.\u201d There's one key point here: Despite how her decision is being presented, Yates didn't actually say Trump's executive order isn't legal. She said she is not \u201cconvinced that the Executive Order is lawful.\u201d Yet words such as \u201cnot lawful, \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d have often been attributed to Yates. And that's a key distinction. Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law expert at the University of North Carolina, largely agrees with Goldsmith and Tofel. He said Yates is taking an unusual stance. \u201cShe's not really stating clearly that she thinks it\u2019s unlawful; she's saying, 'I\u2019m not convinced.' \" Gerhardt said. \u201cWell, that\u2019s an odd way to formulate something.\u201d Gerhardt, who has advised Democrats and served on President Bill Clinton's transition team, added that Trump's removal of Yates isn't all that exceptional. \u201cWe\u2019ve had notable dismissals of Cabinet officials in the past, extending all the way to Andrew Jackson \u2014 if not before \u2014 so it\u2019s at least well-settled law that a president can get rid of a Cabinet member for any reason he sees fit. He's well within his authority to do this,\u201d Gerhardt said. He added: \u201cThere are a lot of people jumping rather fast analogizing this to the Saturday Night Massacre. That unfolded a little differently, and the dismissals were different than these conditions. It had to do with arguable misconduct [by Richard Nixon].\u201d Peter Smith, a constitutional law expert at George Washington University, differs with Goldsmith somewhat, saying Trump's executive order may have warranted an extraordinary response. Smith said the available legal defenses of the executive order were weak and run up against \u201cthe trifecta of federal statutes, treaties and the Constitution.\u201d \u201cA federal statute prohibits certain immigration decisions based on national origin; the United States has approved treaties requiring certain treatment of refugees; and the Constitution prohibits government action that is designed to burden members of one religious group (and to provide preferential treatment of members of a different religious group),\" Smith noted. Smith said that \u201cintuitions about the attorney general's obligations tend to turn on whose ox is being gored.\u201d And that's certainly a big takeaway here. The temptation on the left is to view things like what Yates did as heroic and Trump's response as petty and heavy-handed. In the face of what one side believes to be a menace \u2014 and especially religious discrimination, which is what Democrats see Trump's executive order as \u2014 any kind of resistance will be cheered. But this is a complex legal situation \u2014 and one that invites plenty of debate.", "source": "washingtonpost", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "authors": ["aaronblakewp"], "type": "article", "author_string": "aaron blake"}, {"title": "This was SNL\u2019s most politically potent sketch this week", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/05/this-was-snls-most-politically-potent-sketch-this-week/", "text": "It's no surprise that \"Saturday Night Live\" poked plenty of fun at President Trump in its first new episode of his presidency.

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) FiveThirtyEight posed a really interesting question Thursday morning: \u201cIs the overwhelmingly negative tenor of Trump coverage a problem for the media, even if it's 100 percent warranted? 1 interesting Q: Is overwhelmingly negative tenor of Trump coverage a problem for media even if it's 100% warranted? https://t.co/OYaLT7ofK5 pic.twitter.com/SwwduREeni \u2014 Micah Cohen (@micahcohen) October 5, 2017 The impetus is a recent Pew Research study showing coverage of President Trump's first 60 days was about 12-to-1 negative \u2014 much more negative than for other recent presidents. It is not the first study to show this, and last time I made the case for why such negative coverage was warranted. I stand by that. Trump has done an unprecedented number of controversial, norm-breaking things, and he's told an unprecedented number of often-blatant falsehoods. Whatever you think of his presidency or personal qualities, he's demonstrated a willful disregard for facts, and he seems to subsist on reality-TV-esque manufactured controversies. Because of those things, the coverage is unavoidably going to appear more \u201cnegative\u201d than \u201cpositive\u201d \u2014 no matter how you define those words. But that's not the same as asking whether this is helping the media. I'll say four things: I do worry it is hurting the media with a large portion of the country, possibly irreparably so. I'm not sure that can really be avoided \u2014 at least to a large degree. The new political and media paradigm in the United States undoubtedly feeds and rewards negative coverage of Trump. We all need to be super careful. I've wrestled with this question regularly. My job means writing about Trump a lot, mostly analytically. And most of the things I write about Trump would undoubtedly be coded as \u201cnegative\u201d by these studies. When Trump does something controversial, the question isn't about whether to write something, but what can I say that hasn't already been said dozens of times? My beat also includes holding politicians accountable and parsing their words. Trump is a gold mine of content for me. Checking Twitter in the midst of a controversy often serves to reinforce \u201cnegative\u201d angles. One of the odd realities of the Trump presidency is that lots of \u2014 and maybe even most \u2014 top conservative thinkers and right-leaning journalists will often join Democrats in their outrage over the latest Trump apostasy. Whereas social media might once have been a good place to see what both sides are arguing, on Trump it has become more of an echo chamber, with even conservatives reinforcing the belief that What Trump Just Did Is Very Suspect. That's not to say the echo chamber is wrong. If you look at Trump's actions, and his policies like the border wall and the travel ban, in most cases a majority of Americans disagree with him. Those defending Trump usually boil down to about 75 percent of the Republican Party base \u2014 or about 35 percent of the country \u2014 mostly not including the \u201cestablishment\u201d class. GOP lawmakers and Trump aides will also speak out in almost unprecedented ways. Even if you don't believe that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson actually called Trump a \u201cmoron,\u201d you've got Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, starkly and publicly criticizing his Charlottesville response. And the same day the \u201cmoron\u201d story broke, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) suggested the administration would be in chaos if not for Tillerson and a couple generals. These things don't just happen, and they betray the real concerns there are about Trump among those who can most closely observe him operate. If the media didn't cover this discord and controversy, it would be abdicating its role. If it didn't fact-check the thousands of untrue things Trump says \u2014 literally \u2014 it would be rightfully criticized for failing to do its job as a watchdog of American government. The thousand untrue things account for a huge portion of \"negative\u201d coverage, but there's really no other way to do it other than to call out controversies and falsehoods. But that doesn't mean this whole back-and-forth doesn't hurt the media. And it doesn't mean the media can't take it too far, barraging the White House with negative coverage because it isn't in touch with Trump's base and doesn't carve out time between Trump's self-inflicted controversies to see the positive. Trump's presidency has taken a rift between the mainstream media and the conservative base and turned it into a chasm, and I've become convinced it's more strategic than most realize. If you look closely at the controversial things Trump does and says, he'll almost always leave himself and his base some plausible deniability. He says something without technically saying it. He's constantly inviting the media to read too much into his innuendo and inviting the people who already believe he's great to give him the benefit of the doubt. The sum total is that Trump supporters who were already concerned about the \u201cliberal media\u201d now see an avalanche of negative coverage of their president, and it only reinforces their belief that we are out to get him. We can point to Trump's clear falsehoods, but if we have no credibility left with Trump supporters, they'll assume we're dishonestly spinning something he said. \u201cFake news\u201d is a perfect mantra because it invites his supporters to dismiss what we say out of hand, without even arguing the specifics. I can say confidently that about 95 percent of criticisms I personally receive from Trump supporters don't actually take issue with anything I've written. They're just personal insults, accusations of bias and chants of \u201cfake news.\u201d There are no easy answers here, and the media has a role to cover more than just the he-said, she-said of politics. If an administration is riven by infighting and a commander in chief who doesn't inspire confidence in those around him, that is a massive story that must be covered constantly. If a special counsel is trying to ascertain whether the president himself obstructed justice or his campaign colluded with a foreign government, that is also a massive story. If that commander in chief seems to have no real grasp of or respect for the truth? Massive story. But if one-third of the country already believes you are irredeemably biased, those stories are only going to cement that belief. All you can do from there is try to make your reporting and analysis as fair and honest as possible, and hope that one day those people give you a chance again.

The other three have served as safe havens for terrorists \u2014 countries where the government has lost control of territory to terrorist groups like ISIL or al Qaeda and its affiliates,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThis increases the risk that people admitted here from these countries may belong to terrorist groups, or may have been radicalized by them.\u201d\n\nHe said those countries are unwilling or unable to help vet visitors coming to the US, compromising \u201cour nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis executive order provides a needed pause, so we can carefully review how we scrutinize people coming here from these countries of concern,\u201d he said.\n\nThe revised order will not apply to people who had a valid visa as 5 p.m. Jan. 27, 2017, around the time the first travel ban was signed by Trump.\n\nThe new order launches a 90-day period for the Department of Homeland Security to define a new series of requirements for countries to have full participation in US entry programs.\n\nFor countries that do not comply, the State Department, DHS and intelligence agencies can make recommendations on what, if any, restrictions should be imposed.\n\nThe new order spells out detailed categories of people eligible to enter the United States, such as for business or medical travel, or people with family connections or who support the US.\n\nTwo other major changes from the initial immigration order: The new order will no longer give preference to individuals from a \u201cminority religion,\u201d such as Christianity. That distinction gave more fodder to critics who said the initial order was targeting Muslims.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer repeated those criticisms Monday, saying the new order does nothing for national security.\n\n\u201cA watered-down ban is still a ban. Despite the administration\u2019s changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more. It is mean-spirited, and un-American.

It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this. There is no effort at all to round up, to utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants,\u201d he said, before admonishing the media.\n\n\u201cI wish you guys had asked before you tweeted,\u201d he added, though an AP reporter noted that the wire service had asked multiple times before publishing the news but got no response.\n\nHe hedged when pressed about where the draft statement came from if not the White House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what could potentially be out there, but I know that there is no effort to do what is potentially suggested. It is not a White House document,\u201d he said.\n\nThe AP said that governors in the affected states would have a choice whether to have their guard troops participate, according to the memo, written by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.\n\nWhile National Guard personnel have been used to assist with immigration-related missions on the US-Mexico border before, they have never been used as broadly.\n\nThe memo is addressed to the then-acting heads of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nIt would serve as guidance to implement the wide-ranging executive order on immigration and border security that Trump signed Jan. 25, the AP said.\n\nSuch memos are routinely issued to supplement executive orders.\n\nThe draft memo says participating troops would be authorized \u201cto perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension and detention of aliens in the United States.\u201d It describes how the troops would be activated under a revived state-federal partnership program, and states that personnel would be authorized to conduct searches and identify and arrest any unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe draft document has circulated among Homeland Security staff over the last two weeks. As recently as Friday, staffers in several different offices reported discussions were under way, according to the AP.\n\nIf implemented, the impact could be significant. Nearly half of the 11.1 million people residing in the US without authorization live in the 11 states, according to Pew Research Center estimates based on 2014 Census data.\n\nUnder current rules, even if the proposal is implemented, there would not be immediate mass deportations. Those with existing deportation orders could be sent back to their countries of origin without additional court proceedings. But deportation orders generally would be needed for most other unauthorized immigrants.\n\nSpokespeople for the governors of Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Oregon and New Mexico said they were unaware of the proposal, and either declined to comment or said it was premature to discuss whether they would participate.\n\nThe other three states did not immediately respond to the AP.\n\nThe proposal would extend the federal-local partnership program that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration began scaling back in 2012 to address complaints that it promoted racial profiling.\n\nThe 287(g) program, which Trump included in his immigration executive order, gives local police, sheriff\u2019s deputies and state troopers the authority to assist in the detection of immigrants who are in the US illegally as a regular part of their law enforcement duties.\n\nThe draft memo also mentions other items included in Trump\u2019s executive order, including the hiring of an additional 5,000 border agents, which needs financing from Congress, and his campaign promise to build a wall between the US and Mexico.\n\nThe signed order contained no mention of the possible use of state National Guard troops.\n\nAccording to the draft memo, the militarization effort would be proactive, specifically empowering Guard troops to solely carry out immigration enforcement, not as an add-on the way local law enforcement is used in the program.\n\nAllowing Guard troops to operate inside non-border states also would go far beyond past deployments.\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration strategy emerges as detentions at the nation\u2019s southern border are down significantly from levels seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Last year, the arrest tally was the fifth-lowest since 1972.\n\nDeportations of people living in the US illegally also increased under the Obama administration, though Republicans criticized Obama for setting prosecution guidelines that spared some groups from the threat of deportation, including those brought to the US illegally as children.\n\nLast week, ICE officers arrested more than 680 people around the country in what Kelly said were routine, targeted operations; advocates called the actions stepped-up enforcement under Trump.\n\nWith AP", "source": "nypost", "publish_date": "2017-02-17", "type": "article", "authors": ["daniel halper"], "author_string": "daniel halper"}, {"title": "Donald Trump rages about a Mark Cuban POTUS run", "url": "http://nypost.com/2017/02/12/trump-trash-talks-critics-cnn-and-not-smart-mark-cuban/", "text": "Donald Trump blasted fellow billionaire Mark Cuban on Sunday by claiming he lacks the smarts to become president after the New York Post published a report that floated the Dallas Mavericks owner as a White House challenger in 2020.\n\n\u201cI know Mark Cuban well.
